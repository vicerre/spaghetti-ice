# Vignette 050 â€“ Three Nines

> "Right, now where was it...?"
>
> Solana swivels to the supercomputer and begins typing, followed by a loud button press.
>
> "There we go."
>
> A moment later, a scan of Vic's body appears on one of the monitors.
>
> "The body showed signs of lacerations from just under the temple and out through the cranium. If I had to guess, it was a solid object with a radius of around ten millimeters, traveling at a speed of several hundred meters per second, with its source originally..." She points to the lower right region of the screen. "There."

> Solana turns towards Alis, her expression impenetrable.
>
> Alis looks modestly impressed with her analysis.

> "I've got to say, you killed him really efficiently," she says. "Vic wouldn't have had time to register pain before his brain functionality ceased."
>
> She lifts a finger. "Fortunately, Arklight Limited has access to world-class biotech that can be used to mend or augment existing organisms for a wide variety of functions," she says, prattling her elevator pitch.
>
> She lowers a finger. "Unfortunately, our range of services excludes operations on humans or variations thereof."
>
> She smiles cheekily. "Well, that's what the accounting books should say, at least."

> "You have experience with human reconstruction, I take it?" Alis asks.
>
> "...No, actually," Solana replies. ["Sure, we like to joke that this is mad science,](../2023-q2/2023-06-06_elucidation-024_mad-scientist-tropes.md) [but Vic considers sentient creatures too valuable to work on."](../2022-h2/2022-09-25_icebreaker-005.md)
>
> "I see," he replies. "I suppose my services would be of help here."
>
> She nods.

> Solana adds, "Then there's the mind. Even if we have the technology to reconstruct the body, reconstructing the mind is _kind of_ impossible if it's not fully intact."
>
> She points to the supercomputer screen. "We still have three [nines](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nines_(notation)>) of the brain, but trying to function with three nines of a brain is like trying to function with a heart that skips every thousandth beat."
>
> She swivels the chair towards Alis. ["But in a freak coincidence, we know someone with the exact same neural patterns as him."](../2022-h2/2022-08-05_vignette-003_log.md)
>
> "Fill in the absent pieces with pieces from my own mind, I take it?" Alis replies.
>
> Solana nods sternly. "That's the plan."

> Alis seems somewhere between bewildered and intrigued. "I don't mean any offense when I say this," he comments, "but I never imagined you as capable as this outside of Armin's stead."
>
> ["Well... I _did_ get infected with Arclight," she says.](2023-08-31_vignette-046_wrong.md) Then, fidgeting with her hair, she adds, "Besides, I really, really want to get Vic back."
>
> Alis sighs faintly. "I do too."
