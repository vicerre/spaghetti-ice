# Vignette 048 – A Sign

> "Hey Storyteller, are you there?"
>
> Solana was sitting cross-legged in Vic's lab chair, her head craned towards the fluorescent lights overhead.
>
> It had been two days since the universe destabilized and Alis left for his own universe. Since then, she had been restoring the lab. The debris created by the initial shock had been cleared, and thanks to Arclight, she had restored the coordinates to Alis's dimension. What remained of the lab was now mostly intact.
>
> "...I don't know if you can hear me, but it's Solana."
>
> Well, the parts of the lab that weren't her, at least.

> Ever since the universe had begun to destabilize, Solana's body had begun to deteriorate. The trace spatial emissions previously detected now billowed like wildfire, burning away her body. The universe was eating itself to keep itself alive.
>
> "...I found out what happened to Vic," she murmurs. "And, uh, I see why Alis left so suddenly."
>
> She stretches an arm upwards, presenting it to an invisible audience. Much of her hand had decayed already, and the parts that remained felt numb.
>
> "For him to die so suddenly and for the universe to destabilize so shortly after... those events had to be connected, right?"
>
> Solana reclines back into the chair, resting her head against her remaining palm. "I wish I could talk directly with you like Vic, but I can't."
>
> With a sigh, she adds, "I still wish had a sign of some sort, you know?"
>
> As if on cue, she hears footsteps in the direction of the interdimensional portal. Alis had passed through it and into the lab. As he does, Solana feels oddly tingly—the numbness in her hand lifts.
>
> She stretches her fingers and blinks.
>
> "...That works," she says.
