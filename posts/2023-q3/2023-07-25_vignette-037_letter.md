# Vignette 037 â€“ Letter 202X-07-15

> Dear Solana,
>
> Thank you for the evening together. I enjoyed learning about the video games you play in your spare time, and I hope you enjoyed my summary of the latest advances in bioengineering. As an aside, it seems I make accommodations to my space for more frequent visits.
>
> Over the course of the evening, I came to an epiphany about myself (You are very skilled at triggering these, I must say!):
>
> When I spend time with you, I don't feel the need to prove myself. You know I delight in sharing curiosities or planning mysteries with you in mind, but I noticed how liberating it can be to set those plans aside.
>
> I confess, you made me realize I had been afraid all this time. I feared losing you as a friend if you saw me as anyone less practiced and confident. I suppose it sounds rather ridiculous when written, but given past experience, this was a very tangible fear.
>
> That's not to say I'll shed my public guise, of course. The enthusiasm you see is quite genuine, as is my fondness for you.
>
> Let's continue having fun, shall we?
>
> A. Vicerre
>
> P.S. I highly suggest burning this letter after reading it. It emits a pleasing alpine scent.
