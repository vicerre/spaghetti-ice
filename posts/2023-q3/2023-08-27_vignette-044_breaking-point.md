# Vignette 044 – Breaking Point

> [...]
>
> "Is _that_ what this all is?" Alis exclaims. "Some sort of puppet show orchestrated by an all-powerful mastermind? ...And all this time, you knew the truth?"
>
> All of a sudden, an icicle manifests on the ground, the tip aimed at Vic's head.
>
> With hesitance, Alis adds, "...Was every interaction of ours planned out from the start?"
>
> Vic stares at the icicle, takes a shaky breath, and looks at Alis.
>
> "You know the answer to that already, don't you?" he replies.
>
> He doesn't attempt to negotiate; Alis was coming into his own, and he knew fate would come for him, one way or another.
>
> Not a moment later, the icicle twitches and shoots forward.

---

> Time stops.
>
> The icicle hangs outstretched, just short of reaching its target. Alis had become immobile, his wrath suspended in this instant.
>
> Vic, on the other hand, was fully functional; after all, he knew I was there to interrupt Alis, and he knew I would grant him agency.
>
> "Storyteller, don't," he says to me. "You'll only prove him right if you intervene."
>
> I usually try not to interact with my characters. If I disrupt the universe, I might blur the boundary between the universe and fiction.
>
> That didn't matter now, I suppose; Vic was negotiating the terms of the universe.

---

> "Storyteller," he says.
>
> "In the past, I experienced a similar personal crisis. While in the Dream World, I couldn't handle being powerless, I took it upon myself to prove my agency against the Dream World's Gamemaster.
>
> "And in response, the Gamemaster humbled me. Not only did they deprive me of the abilities that defined me, but they also rewrote my soul to make me more pliable with their terms.
>
> "...That's what you plan do with him, I imagine? You would strip him of his abilities, leave him to search the depths of his soul, and restore him as he finds the answers he needs. Considering my own fate, it seems like the natural course of action."
>
> I respond in the affirmative; I had seen the result of Alis's actions in several timelines already, and I couldn't let him pursue his current course.
>
> "You should know, then," Vic responds. "It wasn't the Gamemaster who found the answers I needed. Likewise, this intervention isn't what Alis needs. After all, we're still missing one step on the timeline before that pivotal moment—the one that leaves someone dead."
>
> I knew what he was referring to.

---

> After a long pause, I respond to him.
>
> "You know you'll die if I don't intervene," I tell him.
>
> "I'm aware," he calmly replies.
>
> "...Are you sure about this?"
>
> After a brief silence, Vic emits a small laugh.
>
> "For years, I had hoped I could rest knowing I had left the world better than how I had come into it. I had hoped my actions would be enough."
>
> He focuses on the tip of the icicle.
>
> "And yet..." he adds. "When I'm staring death in the face, I can't help but think of the things I've left unfinished. I can't break Solana's heart, and I can't leave Alis without a future.
>
> "...How can I leave now when I have so much to do for the people I care about? It would be a tragedy if this death was my legacy."

> Vic looks to me.
>
> "Let me ask you a question in return, Storyteller," he says.
>
> "What is your intent? Are you here to write a tale of twists and thrills, or are here to guide your characters along the most fulfilling paths for them?
>
> "If it's the former, I suppose I must accept my fate. If it's the latter, I suppose you must exert your authority. Or... can you find a third, golden option?"
>
> "At some point, time must resume, and when it does, you must be the one to make the call."

## Option 1

[non-canon]

> Once the flow of time resumes, the movement of the icicle comes to a halt.
>
> Alis then trembles.
>
> A moment later, he loses his focus on Vic, and his expression goes empty, replacing the anger and confusion that plagued him just moments ago. In that instant, it was though he was simply... gone.
>
> A moment after that, he regains his awareness. He stares at the icicle, confusion faintly resurfacing.
>
> "What just...?" he murmurs.
>
> Vic takes a deep breath. "...The Storyteller," he says, disdain in his voice.

---

> "They're taking the steps necessary to subdue you," he explains. "They've disabled your abilities and rewrote your soul to better comply with their terms."
>
> "Rewrote...?" he murmurs. "As in changing who I am?" With slight consternation, he adds, "I can't accept that."
>
> Vic looks away, brows bunched. "The Storyteller is the ultimate authority across both our universes. If they make up their mind, there's nothing I can do."

---

> Alis rattles a little. "...So that's how it goes?" he says.
>
> Gravely, he adds, "Should you step out of line, you become one of the Storyteller's puppets?"
>
> He looks a little pained at Vic, as if he were wondering the same had applied to him—and if so, when the change transpired.
>
> Vic hangs his head and scowls.
>
> "I would rather think the Storyteller is here to reclaim you as one," he says.

## Option 2 (2023-08-30)

> Once the flow of time resumes, the icicle reaches its target. The impact is quick, precise, and ruthless, cleanly piercing through Vic's skull.
>
> The icicle retracts, and Vic slumps to the floor.
>
> Alis stares at the now-rumpled body in disbelief. He fully expected resistance from Vic or the Storyteller, to prove how either of them would exert their control over him when a life was at stake. In his mind, he was incumbent to fate—and thus, he had no choice but to defy it. For them to show no resistance whatsoever was wholly unexpected.
>
> He scans the mind of the person in front of him, only to find all neural activity ceased.
>
> His stomach grows into a bottomless pit.

---

> Solana was in the lab with Clementine when she notices an alert on the supercomputer; the lab's instruments had detected a sustained decrease in spacetime integrity.
>
> She dials Vic and receives no response.
>
> She tries again and receives no response.
>
> She figures he had plans and would pick up soon enough.
