# Vignette 038 – Experimented

> The first thing Solana notices upon waking up is the sound of muted tapping against glass.
>
> The next thing she notices is her surrounding environment. She was unclothed and suspended in—well, not water, but a different sort of liquid—one that covered her vision with a blurry, teal filter. It was the medium they used in the lab.
>

> She couldn't say the experience she woke up to was unexpected.
>
> "You're awake," she hears.
>
> Past the liquid, she makes out a figure, who she identifies as Vic.
>
> She waves "hi", and he waves back.

> "I was thinking, you know," Vic says. "That fateful day, you emerged from the dimensional fracture. I had never seen you before, yet it was though I had known you for years."
>
> Gesturing towards the supercomputer, he adds, "Your radiation signatures are beyond natural, yet your physiology indicates the opposite. Considering the status of this universe, I suspect your very existence has repercussions beyond your ken."
>
> He folds his arms back. "For the longest time, I've wanted to verify my suspicions," he says. "Yet, I couldn't be sure how receptive you would be to upon being experimented."
>
> Returning his gaze to her, he adds, lightly, "I'm very glad I have your trust now—it makes the process so much simpler."
>
> He taps the glass again and shares a mild, nonchalant expression with her. "Ah, but do let me know if you have any objections, won't you?"
>
> Solana thinks for a moment, then gives Vic the thumbs-up.
