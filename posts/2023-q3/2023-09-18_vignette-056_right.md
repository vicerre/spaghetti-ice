# Vignette 056 â€“ Right

> Alis had set up the neural transfer matrix before he and Solana went on their excursion the prior evening. This was the key component that allowed for mental reconstruction. Now that it was half past nine, it was time to proceed.
>
> Right then.
>
> Reconstructing physical matter was a well-studied subject and simple to apply, relatively speaking. In contrast, reconstructing the mind was cutting-edge science. Alis was experienced in the subject, but bringing science to real-world applications was something else. He knew that all too well the first time he tried and failed to bring back his incarnation of Armin, after all.
>
> Considering the current circumstances, he was... optimistic.

> "Well, Armin, here I am," Alis says.
>
> He brings a chair and Armin's laptop to the front of the reconstruction chamber, then sits down.
>
> "In a few hours, you'll be in a position to return to this plane."
>
> He types a few inputs into the laptop, and the reconstruction chamber whirs with energy.
>
> "If I know anything about you, you're not fussed this entire outcome of events. If anything, I imagine you'll be pleased with how this all turned out."
>
> Next to the chamber was a complicated-looking headpiece, connected by cables to both the chamber and the supercomputer. This was the device that would form the bridge between his and Armin's synapses. Over time, this would let Alis reconstruct the rest of Armin's mind.
>
> "Solana should be arriving around the scheduled end of the procedure. I imagine you'll want to see her as soon as you step out."
>
> He mounts the headpiece, then inputs a final command on the laptop.
>
> "Right then," he says. "Here we go."

> Suddenly, the floor underneath Alis rocks, and the overhead lights sway and flicker.
>
> The restoration chamber briefly snaps into strange, twisted shapes before correcting itself. A moment later, it spews forth a large puff of smoke, and from within it comes a heavy thumping sound.
>
> Upon experiencing this sequence of events, Alis feels as though his heart were squeezed tight.
>
> The laptop flashes briefly, indicating there was more that had occurred inside the chamber.
>
> Alis wasn't sure if he wanted to read on.

> According to the readings, Armin's vital signs had shifted. Five seconds ago, they matched his standard values. Now, however, they didn't match anything remotely normal.
>
> Yet, there was something uncannily familiar about the data.
>
> Much of the recorded numbers did not match standard human parameters. However, they were still _consistent_ and _precise_. If it were a defect in the monitoring systems, he would not see such consistency.
>
> If these numbers don't match against known _human_ data, could it mean they match against...?
>
> When he realizes what the data implies, his eyes grow wide.
