# Rendition 039 â€“ Solana Sprite (2023-07-02)

<img src="assets/2023-07-02_image-073.png">

## Overview

When creating a sprite for [Solana's color palettes](2023-07-05_rendition-038_fighting-game-palettes.md), I wanted to use a large-scale sprite originally. When working on the sprite, however, I encountered several difficulties; the pose was too passive for a sprite ostensibly for a fighting game, and I could not pose the legs as desired. Thus, I abandoned this sprite in favor of a smaller, simpler sprite.

The image depicted here represents the last snapshot of the original, large-scale sprite.
