# Vignette 035 – Midsummer Night

> Solana was somewhere new this evening.
>
> It was only ten minutes ago she called Vic about hanging out at his place for the evening. "It's only the hottest day of the year," she said, "and it seems like your place is always cool."
>
> Now, she sat cross-legged on Vic's bed. On the ground was Clementine, and seated next to her was Vic.
>
> Solana wasn't sure what to expect from Vic's bedroom. If anything, she couldn't say it was unexpected; the memory foam beneath her was carefully chosen, the curtains were thick enough to blot out the midday sun, and the acoustic wall panels were arranged ever so precisely.
>
> Even in his private quarters, Solana still felt as though she were assisting him in some sort of clinical trial.
>
> When she called him ten minutes ago, Vic admitted the idea of spending time at his place was "a rather novel experience."
>
> She supposes she was helping him with a clinical trial of a sort—one colloquially referred to as a "sleepover".

## Bonus passage – Phone Call

> V: Solana?
>
> S: Hey Vic!
>
> V: It's rather late for a phone call, isn't it? Did you need something?
>
> S: Sort of?
>
> V: "Sort of?"
>
> S: Yeah.
>
> S: Are you free this evening?

> V: Where are you heading with this question?
>
> S: Well, Clem and I were just wondering:
>
> S: It's only the hottest day of the year, and it seems like your place is always cool.
>
> S: Can we hang out at your place for the night?

> V: Ah.
>
> V: Well!
>
> V: ...I suppose I don't have strict reservations to the idea, I must admit, however, this is a rather novel experience for me.
>
> S: Yeah, I figured. Don't worry if this is out of your comfort zone, though—I can work something out at home.
>
> V: Ah—it's fine.
>
> V: Do excuse me if I need to fetch amenities during your stay, however—I can't say my residence is planned with visitors in mind.
>
> S: Well, you have a floor, electricity, and aethernet, right? And you and Clem will be there, of course. That's enough for me.
>
> V: Ah. If you are sure, I suppose I will agree to those terms. If you need anything in particular, however, do let me know.
>
> S: Of course.

> V: In this case, when shall I expect to see you this evening?
>
> S: I was thinking I'll call you in ten minutes to arrange the portal.
>
> V: That comes to a time of twenty thirty-six, correct?
>
> S: Sounds good!
>
> V: Very well then. I will see you then, Solana.
>
> S: Okay—see you later, Vic.
