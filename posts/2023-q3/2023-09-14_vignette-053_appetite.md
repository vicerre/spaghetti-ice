# Vignette 053 — Appetite

> "Hey, Alis?" Solana says.
>
> Alis had been supervising the reconstruction device when Solana stops by.
>
> Solana holds out a takeout container towards him. Alis looks at the container—then her—with mild surprise.
>
> "If you're anything like Vic," she says, "You forget to eat."
>
> She turns briefly to the supercomputer. "According to the logs, you've invited Vic to a Talixian place in the past, so I looked for something in that class."
>
> Alis checks the time and notices eight hours had passed. Taking the container, he notices the surface was warm to the touch, and a mild smell wafted from it.
>
> He turns his attention towards Solana. With a brief pause and a small, grateful nod, he says, "Thank you."

> "I can see why Armin is so fond of you," Alis says.
>
> By now, they had made their way to the dining area. Alis carried the takeout container, and Solana was making her way to the kitchenette.
>
> "You mean besides the food, right?" Solana comments. She was already fetching a tea canister, presumably to complement the food.
>
> Alis nods. "At the moment, I count no less than three charges against you—four, if you include the toll of Arclight on your mental state. Yet, you seem to manage these charges in stride. Not only do you retain stability, but you act as a haven of stability for those you know."
>
> He then adds, with a half-shrug and calm smile, "I can't say I'm not envious you're his."

> Solana turns towards Alis, shyly smiling and brushing a lock of hair away. "It's the least I can do for my friends, isn't it?"
>
> Alis looks pointedly at her. "You insist I'm included in that class."
>
> Solana nods. She then turns away, reaching for what Alis presumes is a tea strainer.
>
> "Hmm," Alis responds.
>
> He turns to the food and prepares to eat.
>
> "Perhaps I'll even start to believe you in due time."
