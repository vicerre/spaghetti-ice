# Meta 010 â€“ Stable Diffusion Testing

<img src="assets/2022-12-30_image-072.png"/>

## Overview

When I experimented with Stable Diffusion, I generated a number of images of Vicerre. Among those generations is an image I'm especially fond of and keep returning to study, which I have presented here.

The elements I find interesting are the following:

- Vicerre's intense, melancholic expression. I would like to replicate this expression using my own skill set.
- The art style. I would like to capture Vic's depiction here in my own style.
