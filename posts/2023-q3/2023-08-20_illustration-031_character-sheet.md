# Illustration 031 – Vicerre Character Sheet (2023-08-18 – 2023-08-20)

<img src="assets/2023-08-18_image-088.png">

## Overview

Following the character sheets I drew for [Alis](2023-08-13_illustration-030_character-sheet.md) and [Solana](2023-08-06_illustration-029_character-sheet.md), I sought to draw one for Vic.

Now, [I drew a character sheet for Vic recently,](2023-07-08_illustration-022_character-sheet.md) and by all standards, it is reasonably up-to-date. However, since I started drawing in Clip Studio Paint instead of Adobe Photoshop, I desired consistency between my reference images. For this reason, I drew another character sheet for Vic.
