# Vignette 052 â€“ Reconstruction

> It was several days later, and Alis was now watching over the chamber that housed Armin.
>
> While the lab had the resources to reconstruct organic matter, it hadn't been set up for it. The majority of resources had been dedicated to organic synthesis, after all. To retool those resources for reconstruction, Alis found he had to jury-rig a system together, using spare parts from both Armin's lab and his. He had concerns about the interdimensional portal breaking as he traveled, but Solana ended up propping it open with a metal beam as a failsafe.

> To his admission, he found the entire process somewhat enjoyable; it wasn't every day you become responsible for the fate of your own counterpart, after all, much less the health of their universe. Besides, he wanted to make good by him and his beloved.
>
> Yet, he also preferred the status quo. It was in this series of events did he realize how much Armin and Solana meant to him, after all. Instead, Armin was out of operation, and Solana's mind was thoroughly occupied.
>
> In any case, it was now the end of the day. The reconstruction chamber was acting as intended, so there was little to do but wait for the process to reach the next stage.
>
> Perhaps he would see if Solana had any plans.
