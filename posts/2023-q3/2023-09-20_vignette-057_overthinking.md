# Vignette 057 â€“ Overthinking

> `I'm okay!`
>
> The instability in this dimension had ceased, and all lab instruments resumed normal operation. Alis was still stationed in front of the restoration chamber, laptop in hand.
>
> `...Er, mostly. Maybe. I mean, it's better than being dead, isn't it?`
>
> Somehow, it wasn't a surprise that Armin was perfectly healthy and transmitting messages through Oneiros already.
>
> `Oh, that's interesting,` Armin adds. `I remember your name as 'Alis', but 'Vicerre' also springs to mind.`
>
> Much less ones with _his_ signature attached.
>
> `...Er, how should I refer to you?`
>
> It had been some time since other people had referred to Alis as his surname. The thought of reclaiming it felt strange; it was not quite foreign to him, but it seemed... dated. It marked who he _was_ rather than who he now is.
>
> He doesn't spare a moment to reply, `'Alis' is fine.`

> `I'm sure you're aware by now,` Armin says, `but when you revived me, you inadvertently revived 'your' Armin as well.`
>
> Alis had suspected as such, but he couldn't bring himself to accept this conclusion.
>
> `I don't know how Solana does it. It's pressing enough processing two sets of memories at the same time. How does she do so with _five_?`
>
> He thought 'his' Armin was irrevocably gone; the simulacrum of him that dwelled in the Mental Plane had vanished after freeing Clementine, and Manifestation had triggered on him when he stopped clinging to the past.
>
> `...Er, Alis?`
>
> And yet, Armin's current state was evidence to the contrary. He never _did_ identify how he retained the ability to manipulate ice outside the Mental Plane. In addition, it wasn't a coincidence exactly _how_ his appearance changed following Manifestation, was it?
>
> `Is everything okay? You've gone silent.`
>
> He was less sure of himself than ever.
>
> `Alis`, Armin states, `can you at least get me out of this thing?`
>
> Alis looks up.
>
> He supposes he could do that.
