# Vignette 045 – By Design

> When this dimension fractured, I lost many things in the aftermath. Objects, people, and entire planes of existence had, quite suddenly, ceased to exist.
>
> I would have said I lost many of my acquaintances, yet you appeared. You knew everything about the events before the dimensional fracture, and, along with that, you knew who I was.

> When the Gamemaster deconstructed and rebuilt my soul, they inserted a fragment of [redacted's]. It was that which opened my eyes towards others. Could it be that, in your own creation, you were formed not only from my past acquaintances but from a part of myself?
>
> I don't have the answer to that, and it's one I'm not sure if I want to pursue.

> Even if this were the case, then what? Does anything change if I knew you were designed for me? You've woven me such a wonderful dream—should I rebel against it and find myself face-to-face with an imperfect reality?

> Even if I'm aware this is a dream, I can still enjoy it while it lasts, can't I? I do so dearly enjoy this dream.
