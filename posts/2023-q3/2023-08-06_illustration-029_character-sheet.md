# Illustration 029 — Solana Character Sheet (2023-08-04 – 2023-08-06)

<img src="assets/2023-08-04_image-085.png">

## Overview

Solana is a prominent character in my narrative. She is a character who appears in many passages and illustrations, yet she is not one I have often drawn in full. I've drawn Vic, another major character in my narrative, many times. In contrast, I've drawn Solana in full only twice <sup>[1](../2021/2021-11-13_illustration-002_solana.md), [2](../2022-h2/2022-11-12_illustration-012_outfits.md)</sup>.

I wanted to provide an updated reference image for her, so I drew one.
