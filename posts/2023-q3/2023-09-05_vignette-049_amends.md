> "Alis," Solana says.
>
> Upon hearing her voice, Alis turns his head towards Solana. His eyes flicker from the characteristic yellow tint of Oneiros to their natural shade of blue. Then, he stares at the emissions billowing from her, his expression wide and fixed.
>
> "Solana...?" he murmurs.
>
> "For the record," she replies, "...Even if you killed Vic, destabilized this universe, and left us all for dead, I'm not mad or upset."
>
> Alis's expression is one of quiet disbelief. "You're remarkably calm about this."
>
> Solana shrugs tiredly. "I chose this life knowing I'd experience ups and downs," she says. "Past lives included."
>
> She looks sadly at him. "It doesn't mean it doesn't hurt."

> "But..." Solana adds, "you came back."
>
> "I suppose I have," Alis replies. He averts his gaze from Solana, searching for something nondescript in the room to hold his focus.
>
> He sighs and focuses his attention on her. "I don't suppose you would allow me to make amends?"
>
> Solana's expression is soft but firm. On one hand, she knew what Alis did was unforgivable, but on the other hand, Alis seemed to realize that, too.
>
> "Actually?" Solana replies.
>
> Her expression turns into a smile. "If we're going to fix the universe, I'm going to need your help."
