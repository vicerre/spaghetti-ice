# Elucidation 029 – Corruption and Purification Tropes

Throughout his journey, Vic would undergo several cycles of corruption and resolution—instances where he would, through external means, become a twisted shadow of himself, then later, find the means to redeem himself.

Outside my universe, I was fascinated by these tropes. I enjoyed morally-upright figures giving into their shadows, and I enjoyed morally-corrupt figures redeeming themselves. [As Alis observed,](../2023-q2/2023-06-11_vignette-031_control.md) the tropes gave my characters an excuse to lash out and a means to be accepted back.

Considering the issues I dealt with then, these tropes naturally found their way into fantasy. Over the course of _Spaghetti Ice_, this pattern repeated itself, with the Arclight virus, Exogeny, and Gamemaster acting as examples.

In retrospect, it's clear why these tropes surfaced thrice over in my universe. The idea of framing one's "negative aspects" into a demon to be vanquished is an idealistic, black-and-white, and unhealthy means of self-actualization. It's a trope that only sticks in fiction. Instead, it was only when I learned to empathize with these "negative aspects" was I able to resolve them, reflecting in my universe as natural character development.

Ultimately, I find the trope of rejecting or defeating one's shadows old-fashioned and stilted. Instead, I'm fascinated by the trope of accepting it.
