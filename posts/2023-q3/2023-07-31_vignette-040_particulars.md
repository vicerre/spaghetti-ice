# Vignette 040 – Particulars

> "Oh good, the initial results are ready."
>
> Solana had been swaddled in towels after the first round of experiments when Vic stops by, laptop in hand.
>
> "Well," he states, "your parameters fall profoundly within those of standard human physiology. Metabolic rates, CBC, physical tolerances, and so on."
>
> He tilts the laptop towards Solana. "...That's rather remarkable, considering the saturation of spatial particles incorporated into your system."
>
> Solana leans over and stares at the screen. Displayed was a graph of herself, colors representing the density of said spatial particles.
>
> She narrows her eyes. Not only were there particles around her body, but there seemed to be emissions coming off her body. A pair of emissions came off the tips of her ears, and four long emissions came off the base of her spine.
>
> "...Huh," she remarks. "Those results make me look like—"

> "A kitsune?" Vic replies.
>
> She slowly blinks, then looks to Vic. "What does that mean?" she asks.
>
> "Well, we've yet to find out, haven't we? These signals could be residual in nature, or latent, or..."
>
> He lifts his eyebrows in whimsical speculation. "Perhaps you've been a kitsune all this time, only you forgot how to shapeshift back."
>
> Solana grins and pushes his shoulder. "Stop it."

> "So," Solana asks, "what are the odds I've got magical powers just waiting to be unlocked?"
>
> Vic places his fingers over Solana's head and sprinkles snow atop her hair. "Considering your circumstances, I wouldn't be surprised if you did."
>
> Solana giggles and holds still, letting the snow accumulate in a small heap. "Then we just have to figure out how to unlock them. I mean, if they exist at all."
>
> "Oh, that the easy part," Vic replies. "Simply form a contract with a malevolent entity from another dimension to sacrifice sanity for power—that's how I obtained mine. I still have the coordinates saved to the interdimensional portal, you know."
>
> Knowing Vic, he probably wasn't even joking.

> He adds, "No, what's more trying is our ability to reason about them."
>
> He dusts the snow off Solana's hair. "As fascinating as these gifts are, they are bound by rules and limitations—ones we've yet to understand."
>
> "In other words," she muses, "...an opportunity to run more experiments?"
>
> "Exactly!"
