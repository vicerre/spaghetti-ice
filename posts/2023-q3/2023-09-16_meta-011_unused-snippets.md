# Meta 011 â€“ Unused Snippets

[non-canon]

This post acts as a collection of favorite lines from recently-scrapped Vignettes.

---

> "...I never formally explained who the Storyteller was, did I?" Vic says. "I think they overheard my urge to crawl into a cave in the wilderness and die."

---

> The receiver picks up.
>
> "Are you there, Vic?" Solana exclaims. "Where are you?"
>
> On the other end of the receiver is a tired, rather disheveled voice.
>
> "Oh... hello, Solana," Vic says. "...Where else but seeing it all end?"

---

> "You know how people use a piece of folded paper to represent our dimension when discussing wormholes?" he adds.
>
> "Well, imagine someone wadding up that piece of paper and setting it on fire."

---

> "You know, I found a backup of the coordinate logs," Solana says. "Out of a hundred thousand worlds scanned, yours was the only one he visited again and again."

---

> "How do you feel?" Solana asks.
>
> Alis looks nonplussed. "I'm sorry?"
>
> "How do you feel? Now that you no longer need to compete with him?"
>
> Alis looks ahead, his eyes not quite focused.
>
> "...Lost."

---

> Solana gripes how Vic designed the lab with portals in mind. Without him, it took _forever_ to wheel an office chair from one end of the lab to the other.

---

> "So..." Solana says. "Aren't you technically a zombie now?"
>
> "You _can_ check my pulse, you know," Vic replies.
