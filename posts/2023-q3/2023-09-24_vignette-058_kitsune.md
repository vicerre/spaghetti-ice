# Vignette 058 – Kitsune

> "Hey Alis, are you okay?"
>
> Solana had just clambered through the lab's utility portal. She was still wearing her pajamas, and her hair hadn't been combed. The spatial emissions that had clung to her vanished.
>
> "There was this crash, and—"
>
> She halts in her tracks.
>
> Seated in front of the reconstruction chamber was Alis. He had a towel in his hand, and he was drying off what looked like solution from the reconstruction process.
>
> Seated beside him? One snow-white kitsune.
>
> The kitsune had bright blue eyes and was covered in thick, snow-white fur from nose to tails. He reached Solana's hip in height, and he seemed slightly damp.
>
> Upon noticing Solana, his ears perk up, and his tails swish excitedly.
>
> Solana's eyes grow wide, and she has to remember she's not dreaming.

> With a lilt in each step, the kitsune trots over to Solana. He presses his snout against her leg, leaving a cooling sensation as he does.
>
> "Hi, Solana," he says.
>
> "Vic?" she says.
>
> The kitsune curls around Solana's legs and squeezes as a sort of makeshift hug.
>
> "More or less," he replies.
>
> He backs up a small distance, then lifts a front paw, loosely shaking it.
>
> "I suppose I'm like you now—someone the universe created by entangling me with my analogs."
>
> He lowers his paw, then glances back at Alis. "Well, it entangled me with _one_ of them, at least."
>
> He looks back at Solana. "On that note, I still have unfinished business to attend to. Will you excuse me for a bit?"
>
> Solana bends down and gives the kitsune a tight hug, then hugs.

> The kitsune trots back over to Alis.
>
> "...This must all be very confusing to you," he says, tails low.
>
> Alis casts his gaze away from the kitsune. After a brief moment, he replies, "The same must apply to you."
>
> The kitsune nods. "Truthfully, I think it would be most effective if I were human again. The part where I've inherited 'your' Armin's form and memories complicates matters, however."
>
> "I can't say I don't miss him," Alis says, his gaze averted.
>
> Noticing Alis's tone, the kitsune replies, "However...?"
>
> "...However," Alis says, now glancing at the kitsune, "...I would much rather have Vic back."

> "Now that you exist again," Alis says, "we can adjust your physical and mental states in the lab."
>
> Alis now looks fully at the kitsune—less so the sort of fixed, uncanny stare he would often give, and more so something familiar and genuine. He then extends a hand and gently ruffles the fur on the kitsune's forehead.
>
> "I don't suppose I could take the initiative and make the appropriate changes?"
>
> The kitsune's eyes grow wide.
>
> He looks down and stares. As he does, his tails roll and twist, the gears in his head turning.
>
> After a moment, he returns his gaze. His tails start to swish again, and he nods.

## Bonus passage

[non-canon]

> With a numb sigh, Alis replies, `This is my fault too, isn't it?`
>
> `Your machinations got us here in the first place, sure,` the kitsune says, `but do I look like I hold things against you?`
>
> Alis gleans the kitsune's figure.
>
> `...Right,` the kitsune says.
