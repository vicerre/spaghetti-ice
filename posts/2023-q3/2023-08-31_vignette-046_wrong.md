# Vignette 046 – Wrong

> "Hey Alis?" Solana asks.
>
> Solana was in the lab, and Alis had just emerged from the utility portal. He was briskly proceeding towards the interdimensional portal, seemingly failing to notice Solana.
>
> "Alis, there's been a drop in the universe's stability," she explains. "I tried calling Vic, but he hasn't picked up.
>
> "Have you seen him?"
>
> Alis suddenly halts and stares at Solana. He had a profoundly haunted look in his eyes. It doesn't take Solana long to realize something was _wrong_.
>
> She wouldn't get an answer from him, however. It wasn't a moment later does she feel the hallmark clawing and biting of Oneiros, and her mind rapidly loses consciousness.
>
> Just before she loses all awareness, however, she could discern Alis muttering "I'm sorry."

> The next thing she knew, she was standing in front of the interdimensional portal, with Alis was nowhere to be seen.
>
> The power to the portal had been turned off. When she turns the portal back on, she sees the coordinate history scrambled.
>
> The supercomputer emits a plaintive beep—a warning of a further decline in the universe's stability.
>
> Then, the ground beneath her convulses. Solana is thrown off her feet, and the overhead lights flicker. Elsewhere in the lab, glass shatters.
>
> When she stumbles back onto her feet, she notices something is wrong with the lab. The instruments and fixtures looked, for lack of a better word, glitched. Some took on strange, warped shapes, some look as though they clipped out of existence, and some didn't quite follow the laws of physics as she knew them.
>
> She rushes back to the supercomputer, seeking answers.
>
> Upon arriving, she notices something amiss on Vic's workstation; the flask that contained the sample of the Arclight virus had shattered, and the particles within were now free.
