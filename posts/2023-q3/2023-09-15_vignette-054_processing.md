# Vignette 054 — Processing

> I've been thinking, Solana.
>
> Throughout my life, I've known simple kindness to be a weakness at best and cruelty at worst. I've known too many instances where people took advantage of my kindness, and I've known too many instances where others used a kind façade to take advantage of me.
>
> All except on two occasions, that is. The first was a chance encounter with a certain ice kitsune, and the second was a chance encounter with you and Armin.
>
> I wasn't aware of it at the time, but I suppose I was under the impression you lot were the same as the rest of them. I certainly thought I'd prove myself right when you would reveal your true nature when confronted with duress.
>
> And yet, you never did, did you? The death of your beloved didn't change that, nor did collaborating with his killer. Even when your own existence was at stake, you never showed any signs to the contrary.
>
> It's as though I'm trying to lift an illusion that doesn't exist—and in turn, I'm merely perpetuating the pre-established cycle.
>
> I think I must reassess my preconceptions.
