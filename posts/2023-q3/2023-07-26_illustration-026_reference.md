# Illustration 026 â€“ Vicerre Reference (2023-07-04)

<img src="assets/2023-07-24_image-080.png">

## Overview

Following [updates to his character design](2023-07-08_illustration-022_character-sheet.md) and several Vignettes in which he saw character growth, I sought to draw Vic again.

## Design notes

- By drawing Vic again, I became more comfortable drawing and developing his updated design.
- Vic's hair has been steadily growing longer. In this drawing, it is long enough to appear over his shoulder.
