# Vignette 047 – Meditation

> Alis was revisiting his Headscape.
>
> Like before, he emerged in the nexus, replete with consisting of rolling hills with the odd tree, pathway, or bench installed. Like before, the snow that once coated the terrain was missing. And like before, the perimeter outside the central area was labyrinthine as ever, composed of tall, steely buildings hybridized with narrow, classical ones.
>
> Alis found the last part interesting.
>
> The steely elements were traits of his Headscape, yes, but the narrow elements were traits from _his_. The only reason Alis's Headscape had been hybridized with Vic's at all was because Oneiros identified them as the same. Now that Vic was inaccessible, he half-expected those traits to vanish.
>
> He faintly wonders if that could mean Vic was still present somehow, but he dismisses the thought as wishful thinking.
>
> Instead, he follows a path from the central area to its perimeter.

> The caltrops and tripwires once scattered about the perimeter had vanished. To wit, the very nature of the perimeter itself had changed; it was _labyrinthine_, not mazelike. As long and winding as it was, there was only one path Alis could take—and it was one he didn't need to think about how to reach the end of.
>
> Things had been quiet recently; it wasn't his universe at risk of collapsing, after all. These past two days were devoid of Vic's mischief and Solana's amity. Solana would have scheduled a visit with a creature called a goldhorn today, but Alis supposes those plans were put on hold indefinitely. Instead, he came to a home that was the same as he left it.
>
> It had been some time since he had the pleasure of true solitude, but today, it just felt like loneliness.
>
> He notes his capacity to feel such a thing.

> He starts pacing.
>
> "What would you do, Armin," Alis asks, "knowing you've made a grave mistake you trust you would never recompense? Supposing you weren't the victim?"
>
> He wasn't sure which 'Armin' he hoped to receive an answer from, but it didn't really matter.
>
> He had paced for several hundred meters when he adds, "...I suppose you've experienced that scenario already. You didn't take it well, either, when you realized the friendship other people offered you was sincere and your self-loathing was self-induced.
>
> "...And, well, now you're dead. You're no longer bound by human limitations. You've become an idea—and one that's rather incorrigible on my psyche."
>
> He smiles wistfully. "To be honest, I think I preferred you when you were still alive."
>
> He then halts, blinking.
>
> "...Why do I have the feeling I'll be the one to make that happen?"
