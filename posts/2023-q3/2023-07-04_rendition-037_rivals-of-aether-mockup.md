# Rendition 037 â€“ Rivals of Aether Mockup (2023-07-03)

<img src="assets/2023-07-03_image-074.png">

## Overview

My characters are at a place where they are narratively settled. In other words, they have evolved to a point where I don't feel an urge to work on them. That's not to say their story ended. Rather, the significance is that I can focus my time on ideas sitting in my backlog.

One such idea was a set of palette swaps for Solana. Previously, I had created two such sets for Vic <sup>[1](../2022-h2/2022-10-12_rendition-025_fighting-game-palettes.md), [2](../2023-q1/2023-02-12_rendition-030_fighting-game-palettes.md)</sup>, and I had plans for Solana. Thus, I started creating a sprite of her for this purpose.

Initially, I planned to create a large-scale sprite, similar to the previous palette swap sprites. While working on this sprite, however, I grew dissatisfied with Solana's pose, so I abandoned it. Instead, I created a sprite in the style of _Rivals of Aether_, [complementing Vic's](../2023-q1/2023-02-22_rendition-031_rivals-of-aether-mockup.md). This sprite was much quicker to finalize, only taking two hours.

The sprite presented in this post is the final product.
