# Vignette 041 – Bloom

> Vic was somewhere particular this afternoon.
>
> He had made his way to a forested area beyond New Quendon. Around here, the trees formed a thick canopy, and lush, green grass cleared his head.
>
> When he arrives at his destination, he checks his phone. He waits for the seconds to tick by, expecting someone.
>
> Moments later, the grass in front of him rustles.

---

> From the grass emerges a large and rather majestic-looking cervoid creature.
>
> The creature was roughly the same height as Vic himself. She had broad, glistening horns and strode on thin, firm hooves. Her pelt had the texture of fresh, soft grass, and the scent of spring wafted from the flowers budding off her body.
>
> Upon stumbling into Vic, the creature assumes a tense position, ready bound away any second.
>
> Before she does, however, Vic speaks up.
>
> "Zada?" he says.
>
> The creature settles down and lifts her head, eyes wide.
>
> A moment later, she speaks back.
>
> "You know my name?"

---

> "Ah, it would be more accurate to say I know your lineage"—Vic replies—"both your predecessor and your current incarnation."
>
> Zada leans in slightly, her eyes round with curiosity. "This is strange to hear," she says.
>
> ...Vic had a feeling he knew why.

---

> Zada adds, "My allies have told me stories about my predecessor."
>
> Her eyes dim a little. "Among those stories is the story of her death."
>
> Bingo.
>
> "She fought valiantly against an overwhelming, shadowy force—"
>
> The Exogeny.
>
> "—and she met her end against a strange, shadowy human."
>
> Himself.
>
> Zada looks at Vic. "The human was described as narrow, with eyes of gold and the power to grow ice. He skewered my predecessor with a tall spike of ice, and I was born from her remains."
>
> Accurate.
>
> "My allies reported this human underwent his own rebirth," she says. "I could hardly believe the idea. I could hardly believe someone as cruel as he was to have a change of heart. I could hardly believe they considered him a friend."
>
> She tilts her head, stepping towards him. "Yet now I cannot help but believe this human is the human standing in front of me..."

---

> After some pause, Vic responds.
>
> "...Suppose the person you are seeing now is that very human."
>
> Zada slowly nods.
>
> He says, "Suppose that person never showed his face again out of shame for what he had done." With some hesitation, he adds, "And suppose that, several years later, he absolved himself of his actions and was ready to step out of the shadows."
>
> Zada's gaze had become fixated on him. Her expression was as firm as steel, yet it was gentle as well.

---

> It was an eternity later when Zada's gaze softens.
>
> "I cannot forgive you for your past misdeeds," she says. "Yet..."
>
> She focuses her gaze towards the ground. In front of her, a small bud emerges from the soil, creaking as it climbs upwards. The bud unfurls and exposes a flower with bright white and pink petals. This was Zada's special variety of flower.
>
> "I sense kindness in your heart, and I cannot leave it dormant."
>
> She gestures for Vic to pick the flower. "This flower is a gift from me to you. If I believe you to be who I think you are, you will find a use for it."
>
> Vic takes it, then looks at her again.
>
> Zada turns away, ready to depart. "I cannot offer you anything else today," she says. "Yet..."
>
> A brief moment later, she gives Vic a gentle bow. "I am glad to hear from you again. Until we meet again, I bid you good tidings."
>
> With that, she kicks her hooves against the ground, leaping away and into the unknown.
