# Vignette 036 – Thermoregulation

> Things had changed since Solana set foot into Vic's bedroom; Clementine had climbed onto the bed and sprawled out, and Solana had migrated to the floor by the bed's feet, where she was now sitting, legs splayed, laptop in hand.
>
> As for Vic...
>
> "Hmm, curious."
>
> Solana looks up and sees him, who joins her on the ground, sitting adjacent to her.
>
> "I can't seem to bring myself to adopt my public persona," he tells her.
>
> Solana folds the laptop, gaze attentive.
>
> "Oh huh," she responds. With a smile, she adds, "Is it because of me, this room," she asks, pointing, "or your lack of shoes?"
>
> Vic chuckles a little, then replies with a small "yes".

> "You requested a visit to my residence for the express purpose of thermoregulation," Vic states.
>
> He lifts his eyebrows in droll expectation. "Something tells me it's not the building's cooling system that interests you."
>
> Solana snickers. "I mean!" she says. "You have ice powers, after all, so it's only natural you'll get asked, right?"
>
> "It's my destiny to be someone's personal cooler," he replies flatly, a light smirk on his lips.
>
> With a simple shrug, she says, "You have to admit, you're cool in more ways than one."
>
> He chuckles back.
>
> "Touché."

> Solana thinks for a moment, then pokes his nose.
>
> Looking at him with a soft, curious expression, she asks, "Touché?"
>
> Vic looks at her warmly, then lightly scoffs at her joke. "Touché indeed."
>
> It's then Solana slowly leans towards him, pressing her body against his shoulder. As she does, a sprinkling of icicles precipitates beside Vic's feet, jittering briefly before dissipating.
>
> For a moment, Vic looked as though he had something to say.
>
> Instead, he reaches for her hand, clasping it with his own.
