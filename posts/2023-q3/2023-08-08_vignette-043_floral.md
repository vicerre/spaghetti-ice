# Vignette 043 – Floral

> Later that evening, Alis and Solana were playing a variant of chess when Vic places a bowl of ice cream next to each of them.
>
> Alis notices the bowl and dips his head in thanks.
>
> Solana takes her bowl and samples a spoonful. Savoring the flavor in her mouth, she comments, "This is pretty fresh and sweet!"
>
> She slowly takes the next spoonful. After thinking a bit, she adds, "It reminds me of honey, but it's got a floral trace, too."
>
> "Well, that part should be true—the key ingredient is a floral extract, after all," Vic replies. "I've longed to try it out ever since I received a sample last week."
>
> "Should we know what flower that is?" Solana says. "It doesn't taste like anything I know."
>
> Vic comes over and pokes Solana's nose. "You'll find out soon enough," he says.
>
> Ah, so it was one of those puzzles.
