# Vignette 055 – Evening Excursion

> It was the following evening, and Alis had returned to Firenze.
>
> Typically, he had little to do after returning home outside his typical obligations. This was not a typical evening, however. Behind him was Solana, wholly enthralled by Oneiros.
>
> According to estimates, it would take fifteen more hours for Armin's physical reconstruction to complete. Afterward, Alis could commence with the next stage. This was just enough time for him and Solana to take their minds off for one more evening.
>
> Alis takes Solana to one of the city's many plazas. In the center of this plaza was a fountain carved with grotesques of fanciful beasts, and around the perimeter were cafés and restaurants of mixed fare. As a whole, the area was bathed in the glow of white streetlights.
>
> Once he had made his way to the plaza's center, he releases Solana from his thrall.
>
> Solana blinks and looks around, curious as a cat to a bauble—this was her first time in Firenze, after all. Alis figured she knew when he described his plans, but he believed the opportunity would delight her all the same.
>
> "Well," he says, "what do you think?"

> As Solana scans the view, Alis speaks up.
>
> "It's funny, isn't it?" he says. "How a practitioner of neuroscience just so happens to hail from a city renowned for its art and culture?"
>
> He then adds, muttering slightly, "...And all this time, he had cast his eyes away."
>
> Solana turns towards Alis, blinking. "Oh huh!" she says.
>
> She then trots up to him and leans in slightly. "Does that mean we'll get to explore Firenze together?"
>
> Hearing this, Alis notices a jolt in his amygdala.
>
> He had invited Solana over for two reasons: one, to reciprocate Solana's kindness, and two, to prove she could trust him. As yet, he considered the outing within standard variances—immerse Solana in a well-known city square, let her browse, perhaps sample a bistro, and return home at the end of the day.
>
> As he had told Solana, Alis didn't engage with the city at large. Instead, he expected to be a passive observer this evening. Now that Solana asked of him, however, he felt inadequate, as though he should contribute more.
>
> And, rather surprisingly, he felt okay with that.
