# Elucidation 031 â€“ Mental Connection Tropes

The trope of mental connection occurs several times in the narrative of _Spaghetti Ice_:

- During the Dream World arc, Vic was instilled with a fragment of [redacted]'s soul.
- During the Second Adventure arc, the protagonists encounter Nia, a cat spirit that can tether herself to objects or people.
- After the dimensional collapse, Vic encounters Alis, an alternate universe analog of him with assorted psionic abilities such as physical manipulation and telepathy.

Whether through a fusion, possession, or mind control, I was fond of tropes that allowed two characters to connect with each other on an intimate level. At the time, I felt utterly alone and disconnected from people who cared about me, so I longed for connection in fantasy.

Of course, emulating personal connection is no replacement for true connection. As I experimented with these tropes, I noticed how devoid I felt outside of these instances. At best, these fantasy connections were a fleeting relief. At worst, they were a crippling dependency.

At the time, the idea of finding real connections seemed unfathomable. When all you knew was an environment of toxicity, the idea of a friendly, sincere support group seemed like fantasy. It would take support and exploration to shake those beliefs off firmly. Yet, now that I've found a community in which I can be myself, I can't imagine settling for less.

Perhaps that is why Alis exists as a character. In some parts, he represents who I was and what I knew at the time. His quasi-future self, Vic, would want to share his experiences and offer him a better future. If I could, I would want the same for my past self.
