# Illustration 027 – Boop (2023-07-25)

## Overview

Since Solana and Vic are becoming more comfortable in proximity, I wanted to draw the two close to each other.

## Design notes

- The pose was inspired by [one of Stjepan Sejic's crossover comics](https://www.tumblr.com/balu8/189514359527/sunstone-blood-stain-by-linda-and-stjepan-sejic). While the original portrays a confrontation between Ally of _Sunstone_ and Vlad of _Blood Stain_, this sketch portrays a friendly interaction.
- As Solana likes animals, Solana would poke other characters on the snout—or nose, as it might be for a human.
- Vic's ponytail is steadily growing.
