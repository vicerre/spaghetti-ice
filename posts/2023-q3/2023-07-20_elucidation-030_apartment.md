# Elucidation 030 â€“ Alis's Apartment

Alis's apartment is a commonly-visited locale in my universe. As examples, Clementine visited it during the events of _Shaved Ice_, and Vic occasionally stops by using the interdimensional portal.

As it is a locale my characters visit often, I have a clear mental image of it. As I had drawn floor plans recently for common settings in my universe, I considered doing the same for Alis's apartment.

As I planned out the layout, however, I quickly realized the layout of Alis's apartment bears significant resemblance to that of [Vic's apartment,](2023-07-17_illustration-024_floor-plan.md) making a floor plan redundant. Instead, what mattered were the differences between the two. Thus, it made more sense to list these differences instead.

As such, I will describe the ways Alis's apartment differs from Vic's:

- The apartment is dustier than Vic's.
- The main room is roughly twice as wide as Vic's.
- The main room is cluttered with biotechnology.
- The main room lacks a bay window.
- The floors are wooden instead of carpeted.
- The lighting cast into the apartment is yellow instead of white.
