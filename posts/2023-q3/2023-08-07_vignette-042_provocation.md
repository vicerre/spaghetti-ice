# Vignette 042 – Provocation

> For a moment, Solana thought she understood eternity.
>
> Along with Alis and Vic, she was seated in the main room of Vic's apartment. Alis was studying Solana intensely, his fingers tented, as Vic fed data into the laptop.
>
> She had just resurfaced from being Alis's thrall. Having visited Alis's Headscape before, she thought she knew what being enthralled was like—a few shots of sharp pain, followed by a slow transition to a dream-like state.
>
> Alis asked to visit Vic when Solana mentioned she'd be hanging out with him this evening. It was then the two started discussing Vic's findings from a few days ago, and it was shortly after they decided to use Oneiros as means of performing tests on her.
>
> She figured time in Oneiros worked differently from the Dream World. She knew she could get a sense of time while in the Dream World. In contrast, Oneiros seemed displaced from time altogether; she could have been suspended for weeks, and she wouldn't know. All she knew was the sensation of a never-ending swarm of pins and needles jabbing into every inch of her.
>
> The sensation would be torturous to some, she imagined, but she saw it as an experience.

> "Welcome back, Solana," Alis says.
>
> Solana nods in return and says, "Thanks."
>
> She looks between the two of them, adding, "Did you find anything interesting?"
>
> Vic scans his notes. "No, nothing exceptional," he says. "Relatively speaking, of course. You have different physiological qualia compared to those of ordinary humans, but then again, so do I."
>
> "Unlike with Armin, we couldn't identify a means of activating latent abilities through physical triggers," Alis adds. "If you have them at all, they might require psychosomatic ones."
>
> "With that being said..." he says, tilting his head towards Vic, "I propose a next course of action."
>
> Vic seemed to know what Alis was about to say, as he stares at him and retorts, "Don't."

> "You're not fond of the idea of traumatizing a friend for science, Armin?" Alis drolly replies. "After all, it worked out for us."
>
> Alis turns back towards Solana and says, "I propose killing him. It fulfills a checkpoint on my timeline, and he's clearly special enough to you that you'll be scarred by his death. In addition, life would be much simpler without his conscience on my shoulder."
>
> Solana could tell Alis was being sarcastic, but this statement still made her heart rush.
>
> "We are _not_ killing anyone over an evening of board games and ice cream," Vic states firmly. "Even if that person is myself."
>
> "Surely your fondness for her doesn't preclude our insatiable curiosity?" Alis argues.
>
> "I would rather spend my insatiable curiosity on the people I care about, thank you very much!" Vic declares.
>
> Solana's heart had settled down by now. "I'd like to focus on the things planned for this evening too," she adds.
>
> After a moment of thought, Alis shrugs. "I suppose we can defer the topic for another time."
>
> He seems to have found the answer he was actually looking for, anyway.
