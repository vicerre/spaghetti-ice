# Vignette 051 – Make Good

[non-canon, takes place after [Vignette 049](2023-09-05_vignette-049_amends.md)]

> "So usually," Solana states, "you can't bring someone back from the dead."
>
> "Presuming your universe follows the same rules as mine," Alis replies.
>
> Solana nods. She then shows Alis her half-decayed arm. "At the moment, though, this universe isn't exactly playing by those rules, is it?"
>
> Alis nods. "This would be the opportunity to take advantage of any emergent faults."
>
> "Right," Solana says.
>
> "For instance, the last time this dimension experienced instability, a bunch of my analogs collapsed into who I am now. I'm someone between all of my past lives—those alive _and_ dead."
>
> She looks at Alis. "You are an analog of Vic, and you are still alive."
>
> She raises her eyebrows. "Do you see where I'm going with this?"

---

> Sometime later, Solana unearthed Vic's wardrobe and asked Alis to dress in Vic's usual wear.
>
> "...Is the outfit truly necessary?" Alis asks. He seemed puzzled by her methods, but he had no reason to deny them.
>
> "Well..." she replies softly, "we both want Vic back, right? And it seems the best way for him to return is to collapse his existence onto yours."
>
> Alis holds still as she fixes up his sleeves.
>
> "Sometimes, you feel more at home if you dress for the part for your role," she states. "It should accelerate the collapse between you and him, at in theory."
>
> "Not only that, but you would prefer to see Vic instead of Alis," he adds.
>
> Solana pauses, then stares away. She had held a red scarf in her hands. [It was the one that once belonged to her, and it was the one she gifted Vic.](../2022-h2/2022-12-23_vignette-013_holiday-gifts.md) Every time he went out, he kept the scarf on.
>
> She runs her fingers through the scarf's length—the fabric was as worn as ever, yet it felt nostalgic all the same.
>
> She silently nods, then drapes the scarf over Alis's neck.

---

> With that gesture, it was as though she had placed the final brush stroke on a canvas, or perhaps the final piece of a puzzle; the facsimile was complete, and the illusion could now take hold.
>
> Something stirs deep in Alis's soul. He would have been forgiven for interpreting the sensation as memories coming to light; instead, it was something far more engrossing.
>
> He felt as though his consciousness were chained to a boulder and plunged into an abyss thousands of fathoms deep. It was though his very being was pulled under.
>
> Solana was right—in some ways, Alis did feel at home. This was a chance to absolve himself of his past guilt, after all, and—more pertinently—his existence at large.
>
> And then, instantly, everything became is as it had been. The twisted shapes of their surroundings had become normal. The decay on Solana had vanished, leaving her body unmarred. The person in front of Solana had ceased to be, and in his place, Vic was reborn.

---

> Solana takes a shaky breath once she sees him stir again. The person in front of her no longer had pure brown hair and cold eyes. Instead, his hair was streaked white and his eyes, soft.
>
> "...Vic," she quietly says. "You're back."
>
> Vic seemed somewhat confused by his presence. "...Solana?" he says.
>
> Solana nods.
>
> He stares aside for a moment. "My memory is a bit muddled currently," he says. "But if it serves me correctly... did you...? Did Alis...?"
>
> Solana nods again.
>
> "Oh," Vic says.

---

> Suddenly, he grasps Solana's shoulders. "Oh, no, no, no, no, _no_," he says.
>
> His expression had swiftly changed from curiosity to abject horror. "Alis is gone, isn't he? You let him make good on his desire to disappear."
>
> Solana's expression tells Vic all he needed to know.
>
> "But he—" Solana says.
>
> "But _nothing_," Vic retorts. "It doesn't matter whether he wanted it or not. I accepted my death knowing I would see Alis live on; I will _not_ let him squander his existence for the sake of my own."
>
> His head hangs down, and he sighs. "...Even if it means I must die again."
>
> Solana lowers her gaze. "Oh," she says, hushed.

---

> He turns his eyes towards Solana. "In a few moments, the Storyteller will erase this timeline. Once complete, you'll return to the moment before you decided to restore my existence."
>
> Solana remains silent.
>
> Suddenly, Vic pulls Solana into a deep, tight hug. "I'll be fine. As so will Alis, and as so will you."
>
> He adds, softly, "It might take a little extra time and work, but I promise we will make good in the end."
>
> Solana can't help but bunch up like a meek kitten; this was the first time Vic hugged her like this. Despite how cool he was to touch, it felt like she was burning inside.
>
> Finally, she reaches her arms around Vic and quietly hugs him back, nodding softly.

---

> "...Right then," Vic says. He pulls away from Solana, waving his hand skywards.
>
> "Storyteller?" he beckons.
>
> I'm here.
>
> He looks to Solana and gives her a firm yet gentle nod.
>
> "Let's go."
