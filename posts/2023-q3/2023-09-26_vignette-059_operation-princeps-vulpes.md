# Vignette 059 â€“ Operation _Princeps Vulpes_

> It was the day following Armin's return to existence.
>
> Shortly after Armin regained consciousness, Alis explained to him how they would grant him back his original form.
>
> "We know a means to induce a physical change in a person given the requisite metaphysical changes, don't we?" Alis said.
>
> "You're referring to Manifestation," the kitsune answered. He sat in front of him, his tails curled around his legs.
>
> He tilted his head. "It's rather bold to rely on this phenomenon, isn't it? The only time we could control its effect was when we had access to the Dream World. Now that it's gone, we can't. We've seen it trigger through the Mental Plane, but its interactions have yet to be explored."
>
> He then stood up and lifted his tails. "I must admit, I'm curious what your plan is."

> "You know three instances where Manifestation triggered without warning," Alis said. "The first two instances occurred when the given subjects were released from the Dream World after having their souls manipulated. The third instance occurred when my sense of self evolved to a critical point after meeting you and Solana."
>
> The kitsune lowered his head shyly.
>
> "My working hypothesis relies on evidence of a fourth," Alis added.
>
> The kitsune looked intently at Alis. "Go on?"
>
> "Unlike you, I didn't accept an infernal deal to obtain the ability to manipulate ice," Alis said. "Instead, I received them after Clementine disrupted my inner workings from the Mental Plane. At the time, I had no explanation for how this change occurred." He glanced at the kitsune. "Nor did I want to think about it, considering..."
>
> "...Right," the kitsune meekly replied.

> Alis looked at the kitsune. "In retrospect, however, the phenomenon matches prior reports of Manifestation. And furthermore, if this was indeed another instance of the same phenomenon, then we have reason to believe it can be reproduced, perhaps consistently."
>
> "So it's back to Oneiros, is it?" the kitsune replied. "And we'll need to invoke a change to my sense of self while there..."
>
> Naturally, after Alis set up all the scaffolding, it takes Armin no more than five minutes to figure out the appropriate trigger.
