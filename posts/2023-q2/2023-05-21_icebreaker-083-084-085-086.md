# Icebreaker 083

> How valuable are your characters to you? Would you exchange the rights to them for anything? For instance, if someone offered you $1,000? $10,000? $100,000? ([2023-04-04](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1093009980241756220))

I would not sell my characters for anything short of a life with complete ease of mind. Considering the cost of living and rate of inflation, I would use $10,000,000 as a ballpark measure for what I would want.

> Which disasters are your characters most likely to set off? ([2023-04-08](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1094185568532959294))

> Alis: Is unlikely to set off a disaster of any magnitude. As he has experience with Oneiros, he has the experience and acuity to prevent further disasters.
>
> Solana: Is just a girl. Anything she induces would be due to naïveté and/or the [butterfly effect](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/butterfly_effect). Alternatively, as she is created from the universe, someone unscrupulous might try to harvest her as a resource.
>
> Vic: Total breakdown of spacetime. Failing that, ecological upheaval from a misplaced portal.

> Why do you create your characters? Do you create them for fun or for something specific? ([2023-05-02](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1103011007649022003), [the-suniverse](https://www.tumblr.com/the-suniverse))

My characters are my subjects of choice when engaging in creative activities such as art, writing, or game design. I enjoy having complete creative control over a world of my design.

# Icebreaker 086

> Which genre of emoticons or emojis do your characters use? ([2023-05-08](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1105261511267582065), [source](https://www.tumblr.com/awfulalignmentcharts/716783677514924032/))

> Alis: Does not use emoticons or emojis, as they have not yet seen widespread usage in his home universe.
>
> Solana: Uses standard [emoticons](../2022-h2/2022-10-08_icebreaker-019-020-021-022-023.md) and [emojis](../2022-h2/2022-09-28_icebreaker-007-008-009.md).

> Vic: Has used `:)` once.
