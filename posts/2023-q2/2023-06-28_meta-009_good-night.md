# Meta 009 â€“ Good Night

## Overview

[This blog started as a bit of an experiment.](../2021/2021-06-28_meta-001_good-day.md)

Initially, I wasn't sure what direction to take it; I wanted to write about and draw subjects that didn't have a place on my primary social media accounts, but I didn't have any particular long-term goals.

For better or worse, I settled on Tumblr as the compromise platform. After researching my options, I found it was the only platform that satisfied these requirements:

- has an active, open community
- hosts posts with marked-up text (i.e. headers, hyperlinks, italics, lists)
- hosts posts with images
- offers a method to organize and sort posts
- offers the ability to edit and delete posts

With some reservations, I joined the website and began to post.

The more I posted, the more this blog found its footing. It became clear that this blog was most effective as a repository for information about my characters and the story they told. Over two years and 150-some-odd posts, I teased out the world that lived in my mind.

And now, exactly two years after I joined, I find I must leave.

### Why

Over these two years, I tolerated many issues with this site.

The first were the platform's inherent issues:

- Image quality: An optimal blogging website lets the user share original-size images. Art-sharing platforms for this. In contrast, Tumblr compresses and lowers image quality. While not a deal-breaker for my needs, I could never share images the way I truly wanted.
- Site search: The site's search system leaves much to be desired.
  - As an example, Tumblr site search does not apply Boolean functions to keywords. In other words, searching for `keyword-x AND keyword-y` should, optimally, produce all posts with both keywords. Tumblr does not offer this feature.
  - As another example, keywords and tags are not guaranteed to produce all search results. A search function that does not return what is expected is useless for organizing data.

Then, my patience with the platform grew thin. Over the course of 2022, my posts stopped appearing in search thrice:

- 2022-01-02: [80LEMY-LDD4] - Instance 1
- 2022-08-01: [P9V302-ZWQLD] - Instance 2
- 2022-08-16: [PM92Q6-8425V] - Instance 2.1
- 2022-09-05: [ERMWGX-E22ZD] - Instance 3

When I contacted site staff about the issue, all I received was silence. It took persistent messaging over the course of weeks for site staff for them to notice and respond to my report.

I recognize this blog is personal in nature, so whether or not my posts showed up on other people's feeds is a minor factor. However, the lack of response indicated the platform did an unacceptable job supporting the social component of the site.

Finally, Tumblr recently announced a deal-breaking change.

Over the course of these weeks, [Tumblr announced removing support for the legacy Markdown editor.](https://changes.tumblr.com/post/719036393883598848/) I rely on advanced Markdown syntax to compose my posts in a way unsupported by the default post editor. If I can no longer compose posts for my content, I'm afraid I must leave.

### What now?

Over two years, I learned what matters to this blog. Thus, I can recalibrate my criteria for a platform. To wit, I've found I don't care about the community aspect of the site as much as I expected. The odd passing Like or Reblog was lovely, but ultimately, this blog was meant for _me_.

With that criterion no longer a requirement, I could identify an alternate platform for my content: GitHub.

"The site where you can share and collaborate on code?" you may ask.

Well... yes. Let's look at the updated criteria, shall we? With the "community" requirement nixed, we can see that we can indeed create, edit, organize, and delete posts with markup using the default feature set of the site. By virtue of posts being composed in Markdown, the site is fairly portable compared to blogging services or wikis. Furthermore, if we need richer customization options, we have the freedom to write code to support these features.

So there we have it. In the upcoming days, I will be relocating the posts hosted on this blog. The majority of the posts will be relocated to GitHub. Some will be relocated to my primary social media persona. Some will stay here.

Once my content has been relocated, I will remove the existing content from this blog and share a link to the blog's new location.
