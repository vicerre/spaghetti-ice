# Vignette 031 – Control

> When you first evaluated Arclight, you were overtaken by its influence and roundly terrorized the majority of New Quendon before you were brought to your senses.
>
> When the Exogeny leaked into this universe and began to corrupt every organism across its path, you were among the first to fall prey to it—until the Exogeny had been sealed away.
>
> When you emerged in the Dream World, you had a chance encounter with the Gamemaster of the domain, who subsumed your sense of self.
>
> And... since you've discovered my home universe, I would not be remiss to think of your interest in Oneiros as another in this series.

> A reprieve from responsibility?

> It's liberating, isn't it? When the demands of life become overbearing, we have the opportunity to simply leave, surrender our agency, and reclaim it at a more favorable time.
>
> We can't bear others to see our flaws and insecurities, so we sequester ourselves behind arcane barriers of our devising.
>
> Even if you are nine years my senior, you never resolved these issues, did you?
>
> ...I suppose I can't say I'm better. Even in our times of lucidity, we both enjoy being cryptic a tad too much.
