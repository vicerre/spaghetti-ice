# Elucidation 024 – Mad Scientist Tropes

Vic leans into tropes associated with the mad scientist archetype. After all, his roots come from the genre, and he finds romantic portrayals entertaining.

Despite this, however, Vic takes umbrage at some tropes associated with the archetype:

1\. Scientists are equivalent to engineers.

Scientists perform experiments and document their findings in research reports. Engineers process this knowledge and determine public applications for them. These professions perform distinct, separate tasks—not that people care, given the pervasiveness of the mad scientist trope.

Granted, there is no reason a scientist cannot also be an engineer. Surely, however, people must be interested in the work of the latter more than that of the former? After all, no one bats an eyelid when someone documents the meaning behind a particular combination of genes in a dragon. Instead, it's the part where someone uses that combination to synthesize a centipede-dragon people find enrapturing.

Personally, Vic doesn't mind referring to himself as a mad scientist, as that is the term that inspires vivid imagery in strangers. However, he would much prefer "mad engineer" to be the general term.

2\. Scientists wear lab coats all the time.

Lab coats act as a barrier between a human and his or her environment. Prancing about in a (possibly stained) lab coat willy-nilly exposes both the environment and the coat to foreign contaminants. In addition, it just gives its wearer more work to do later sanitizing the coat.

Considering much of his work is digitized, Vic finds little need to wear a lab coat in his lab. Instead, he prefers a tweed jacket, as it is more comfortable for everyday functions.

Vic notes, however, that some people—such as a certain red-haired girl—think lab coats give its wearer a sharp aesthetic. Vic relents that much is true.
