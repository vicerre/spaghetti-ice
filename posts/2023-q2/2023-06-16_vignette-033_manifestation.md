# Vignette 033 – Manifestation

> "Armin...?" Alis says. His tone was keen and cut through the air, yet it wavered with a trace of uncertainty.
>
> He couldn't have predicted what had just come about him. In one moment, [Alis had engaged a heart-to-heart with his analog.](2023-06-11_vignette-031_control.md) In the next, [he found himself in an unfamiliar guise, an image moreso derived from fantasy than from reality.](2023-06-14_illustration-021_alis.md) It was as though his very essence had spontaneously blinked into nonexistence, then reappeared in a novel form.
>
> Since then, Armin had been transfixed on him. Even now, his expression was that of pure marvel; his eyes swelled wide and gleamed with stars, and the corners of his mouth tugged upwards.
>
> Alis tries to flush out Armin's attention using the words on his lips.
>
> "Excuse me if I'm prying, Armin, but would you care to explain...?"
>
> Yet, Armin could have been best described as suspended. Despite Alis's words, he was either unaware or unfettered. His faculties might as well have been sucked through the portal and left this dimension altogether.

> Armin would be worse when he _did_ come to.
>
> As though someone had pulled a switch, Armin's gaze snaps to Alis, and he begins to circle him. His eyes weave through Alis's frame, leaping from the strands that composed his hair to the soles that lined his shoes.
>
> Then, he elects to grab Alis's arm by the wrist, seemingly intrigued by the cufflinks Alis had now borne. Then, he opens a portal to the supercomputer to jot down his findings.
>
> If he was trying to examine him, he was taking a very scientific approach.
>
> Armin suddenly positions himself in front of Alis, the gap between them not very wide at all.
>
> "What's my favorite color?" he asks, his tone not having quite reached a demand.
>
> Alis could only answer with a perplexed expression and the word "carmine".
>
> "Ah, very good," Armin replies. "I had to make sure you were yourself.
>
> "As opposed to another analog that happened to have swapped in," he adds. While he was talking, he continued to tap away on the supercomputer, and the monitor manifested an assortment of notes on Alis's appearance and reactions.
>
> "What you're seeing is all normal," Armin says.
>
> He then pauses and stares at an arbitrary point, focusing on nothing in particular. "Mostly."
>
> It was clear Armin was buried in his thoughts; there was nothing Alis could do to disrupt him barring unfavorable measures. Alis could only bide his patience while Armin did what he did best.
>
> "I've only observed this sort of manifestation from those who had visited the Dream World," Armin continues. "But you—you hadn't visited the Dream World at all."
>
> Suddenly, Alis feels a quick stab to his senses. It was as though he were punctured by an extended, honed needle, and before he could register, it slipped away into the void.
>
> Armin strikes a few more keys on the supercomputer, then closes the portal.
>
> "Well, that confirms it." Armin concludes.

> Armin whisks himself and Alis to the tea table. He moves briskly—the kettle over the hot plate and 4.9 grams of loose-leaf but a prelude to the imminent teatime conversation.
>
> _Conversation_, not examination, Alis considers.
>
> "Okay, explanation," Armin says. Bracing his breath, he premiers his attention towards the man behind the visage.
>
> "Traditionally," he says, "the Dream World is just as it sounds. People can visit the Dream World and trifle about it as they will, and their actions will bear no effect on this world."
>
> Armin's gaze lingers carefully on Alis, awaiting Alis's signal for a continuation or otherwise.
>
> Alis dips his head in gripping expectation, then simply adds, "However...?"
>
> Armin responds with an expression somewhere between hesitation and excitement, aware of implications the answer would offer.
>
> "However..." he inches, "There are times when elements from the Dream World can leak into reality."
>
> The kettle clicks.
>
> "I refer to these instances as 'Manifestations'."
>
> Armin found himself occupied again.
>
> "This phenomenon is remarkably rare," he continues, now holding the kettle. "I'm only aware of two instances where Manifestation has occurred."
>
> He pauses, then tosses a light shrug at Alis, as though applauding him on the surprise accomplishment.
>
> "Well, three instances now."

> As he prepares their teas, Armin turns to face Alis.
>
> "Would you like to hear my theory as to why Manifestation occurred now of all times?" he asks.
>
> The question was all but a formality, but Alis finds himself grateful for its presence regardless.
>
> Armin extends Alis his cup, and when he accepts it, he continues.
>
> "[I had come under circumstances which caused my soul to change profoundly,](../2021/2021-07-26_elucidation-004_character-personality.md)" he says. "And shortly after this change, I triggered Manifestation." His tone was that of wistful nostalgia.
>
> "Considering the events directly before Manifestation triggered, would it not be reasonable to consider a similar cause? Perhaps... your self in the Mental Plane had undergone a transformation, and that self manifested in this reality."
>
> The expression on his face slowly evolves from quiet questioning to something firmer. "...I can't explain why, but I'm sure this is the correct explanation."
>
> Alis holds himself in contemplation, stirring the brew with a habitual cadence. He finds his senses enticed by the spearmint's familiar aroma.
>
> A transformation triggered by a profound change to the soul, was it?
>
> He finds himself unwilling to reject the notion.
