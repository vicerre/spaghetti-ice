# Vignette 029 â€“ Spearmint

> The following morning, Solana, Alis, and Vic had seated themselves around the lab's common table. Each of them had a fresh cup of tea in hand.
>
> Alis looks patiently at Solana, who had been staring downwards and quietly chewing her lip.

---

> After a moment, Solana looks up.
>
> "So... everything we read about in your Headscape. ...It's all true?" she says, a slight unease in her voice.
>
> Alis quietly nods.
>
> "...I'm so sorry about Armin," she says. "To lose him so suddenly and for them to sever your research project right after..."
>
> She shakes a little. "That must have been devastating."
>
> Alis solemnly nods. "Everything that mattered in my life had been stripped away. It was as though the fates had chosen to forsake my existence."
>
> "...And that's what drove you to push the Oneiros project to an end, one way or another," Solana murmurs.
>
> Alis nods, then focuses on his tea.

---

> Solana blinks, then leans towards him, softly frowning. "...Why do I feel like there's more you're not sharing with us?"
>
> Without changing his focus, Alis replies, "You didn't come to my Headscape for an extended account of my history, Solana. I have no intent of exposing you to those traumas." He looks up and stares away. "The only parts worth sharing are the ones that pertain to the leaves in your hands."
>
> Suddenly, Solana wonders how much of these hidden traumas were ones Vic was familiar with.

---

> "So uh, the tea is a spearmint blend, right?" Solana says. "Did you acquire the taste before or after..."
>
> Vic waves his free hand briskly. "Alis adopted it because it has a cool flavor and because its common name has 'Armin' in it."
>
> Alis chuckles. "He isn't saying that simply to lighten the mood, either."
>
> Hearing that, Solana nearly stands up. "Seriously?" she cries. It was hard to believe someone like Alis enjoyed wordplay as much as Vic.
>
> Alis shrugs. ["It's your choice whether to believe any answer of mine as pure truth,"](2023-05-31_vignette-028_fluff.md) he says.
>
> "But..." he adds. "Considering who I am an analog of, the answer shouldn't surprise you."
>
> A portal opens in front of Solana, and a small slip of paper falls out.
