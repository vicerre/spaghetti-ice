# Icebreaker 092

> What Pokémon types would your characters be? ([2023-06-20](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1120893328200835154), [darquezze306](https://www.tumblr.com/darquezze306))

Ever since [I answered the question of what Pokémon teams fit my characters thematically,](../2023-q1/2023-01-21_icebreaker-068-069-070-071.md) I've ruminated over the question of how my characters would adapt as Pokémon themselves.

I think this question is interesting for several reasons. Firstly, the subtle distinction shapes the answer in significant ways. Secondly, Alis; since he has exhibited considerable character development since I asked a similar question, a re-evaluation acts as a characterization checkpoint for him.

Using _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_ game data as reference, I designed my characters as Pokémon. Not only did I decide on types as per the original prompt, but I considered abilities, stats, and level-up movesets as well.

Alis:

> Typing: Psychic/Dark
>
> Ability: Analytic/Psychic Surge (_Telepathy_)
>
> Stats: 69/86/60/114/80/104 (BST: 513)
>
> Moves:
>
> 1: Confusion
>
> 1: Leer
>
> 6: Hypnosis
>
> 12: Psybeam
>
> 18: Imprison
>
> 24: Psyshock
>
> 29: Calm Mind
>
> 34: Dark Pulse
>
> 39: Flatter
>
> 44: Nasty Plot
>
> 48: Foul Play
>
> 52: Psychic Terrain
>
> 56: Memento

### Design notes

- The Hidden Ability being Telepathy represents how Alis only opens telepathic communication to those he trusts.
- The stat distribution represents Oneiros's formidable potential.
- The level-up progression represents the patience necessary for Alis's growth. Initially, he learns one move at a pace of one move every six levels. However, this pace increases over time to once every five levels, then once every four levels.
