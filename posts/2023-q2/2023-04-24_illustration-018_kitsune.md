# Illustration 018 – Kitsune (2023-04-18 – 2023-04-22)

<img src="assets/2023-04-18_image-064.png">

## Overview

Kitsune are one of the many species of supernatural creatures that live in the world of _Spaghetti Ice_. Renowned for their high intelligence and wide array of magical abilities, they make excellent companions for those they respect.

## Design notes

- I've never determined what kitsune look like in my universe. I used Ninetales from _Pokémon_ as shorthand, but I've always wanted to figure out a design of my own eventually. This led to the production of this image.
- Kitsune aren't the highlight of my universe, so I didn't want to belabor on their design. Due to this reason, I only consider this image a concept rather than a definitive design.
- This design was an exercise in balancing contradictions. I wanted to create a design that was lean yet fluffy; and cute yet elegant. For the former, I opted to draw the kitsune's body as lean but include tufts of fur at the extremities. For the latter, I drew the kitsune with Ninetales-like proportions.
- The kitsune's diamond-shaped irises mirror Vic's diamond motif.
