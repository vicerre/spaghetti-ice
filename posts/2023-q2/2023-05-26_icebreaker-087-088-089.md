# Icebreaker 087

> Considering the existence of reports such as [SCP-631](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-631), has Vic ever cut a shady deal? ([2023-05-17](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1031694106717589544/1108574506655686706), moscd)

If someone were to request Vic's services for underhanded purposes, Vic would object. The first thing he would comment on are its inefficiencies; if you wanted to eliminate your opponents, there are much more cost-effective methods than to request his services. Furthermore, humans are a valuable assetâ€”it's a waste to kill humans off when you can repurpose them instead.

The best way to convince Vic to accept a shady deal would be to approach him with a project under the pretense that it is science for science's sake, as he you would pique his curiosity. However, he would be dreadfully annoyed with you once he found out the truth.

Or, as Solana would put it...

> Thanks for the application! Vic can't accept your request just yet, but perhaps he can the next time something corrupts his morals.

> What element in the periodic table do your characters associate with the most? ([2023-05-18](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1108717086273970268), inspired by _What If?_)

> Alis: Iron. Like him, it is inflexible and harsh. Furthermore, it has associations with blood, which Alis finds appealing.
>
> Solana: Helium. Like her, it is airy, fun, named after the sun.
>
> Vic: Carbon. He enjoys bioengineering, and carbon acts as the basis for all known life.

> Alis: Stay away from kids.

> Solana: If possible, grab two more chairs. Otherwise, improvise.
>
> Vic: Stack multiple kids on one chair.
