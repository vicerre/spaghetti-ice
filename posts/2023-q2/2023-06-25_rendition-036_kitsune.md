# Rendition 036 – Kitsune (2023-06-25)

<img src="assets/2023-06-25_image-070.png">

## Overview

When I draw, I often get lost in the weeds trying to produce the image. In turn, this slows image production. When [moscd](https://moscd.tumblr.com/) with me, I strongly associated myself with the slow artist.

For this image, I decided to try drawing something looser, focusing on large-scale forms over small-scale detail. Non-human subjects are easier to abstract, so I drew an ice kitsune for this exercise.
