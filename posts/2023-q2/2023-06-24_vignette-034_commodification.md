# Vignette 034 – Commodification

```
**EXT. PERISIAN RESTAURANT – DAY**

Solana and Alis are GRABBING LUNCH outside. Solana holds a BAGEL in hand. Alis holds a CROISSANT SANDWICH in his. Solana takes a BITE.

    SOLANA
    How familiar are you with escape rooms, Alis?

    ALIS
    Might I verify the definition of the term "escape room" with you? I understand one as an environment where the goal is to leave by solving the puzzles within.

    In my universe, they exist only as virtual constructs. They are a curiosity for most—or, I suppose, a challenge for the persevering.

    You, however, describe "escape rooms" as though they were common knowledge.

    SOLANA
    Yeah. Over in this universe, escape rooms here are... well, I'd give you the wrong idea if I called them "real".

    Escape rooms here exist in physical space, but there's no risk involved in entering one. They're closer to arcades or casinos in function—a place you go with friends to have fun together.

She quietly DIPS HER HEAD at Alis.

    ALIS
    ...Not unlike how we've used Oneiros recently.

Solana MAKES AN EXPRESSION halfway between a SHRUG and NOD.

    ALIS (CONT'D)
    I suppose I should be grateful escape rooms normalized _one_ of Oneiros's conceits.

    (dismissively)
    ...The commodification of personal expression, however, I could do without.

    SOLANA
    Right?! Like imagine if Oneiros got popular and people were signing up in droves to try it out. ...But then no one really gets why you created it in the first place. Is that any better than if it stayed unknown?

    At least in _that_ case, the people who knew the project knew _you_ too.

Solana LEANS BACK IN HER CHAIR.

    SOLANA (CONT'D)
    ...Thinking about it that way, Oneiros becoming popular might just be the cruelest way to fulfill your wishes.

    ALIS
    (scornfully)
    One I would be proud of.
