# Elucidation 018 – Animal Motifs

"What animal best represents your character?" is a question I commonly see in character prompts. It's a question I've wanted to answer for Vic, but as of writing, I haven't found a single animal that perfectly reflects him.

In lieu of one answer, I'll list several options I've considered and explain my reasoning for them:

- bat: elongated fingers, nocturnal, spooky
- butterfly: mathematical, metamorphosis symbolism
- cat: clever, fickle, pointy ears
- owl: intelligence symbolism, pointy tufts
- spider: tangled hair, spooky
- squirrel: bushy hair, squirrely

In addition, while kitsune are a major part of Vic's inspirations, I do not associate him with traditional fox or kitsune tropes.
