## Overview

After experiencing _Ghost Trick_, I was inspired to draw scenes with my characters. After a brief brainstorm, I drew Vic and Alis having a conversation in the lab.

Originally, I intended for them to be chatting by the supercomputer, but I thought it would be funnier if I drew them by the microwave instead.
