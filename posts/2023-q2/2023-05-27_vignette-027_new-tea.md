# Vignette 027 – New Tea

> Solana had been responding to a would-be contractor's [dubious project proposal](2023-05-26_icebreaker-087-088-089.md) when a portal opens next to her desk. From the portal emerges cup of tea.
>
> Solana takes the cup and sips.
>
> Then, she pauses and looks into the teacup.

> She promptly turns to the computer and drafts an email:

> Shortly after sending this message, she receives an unexpected response.
>
> `The tea was my idea.`
>
> Solana's eyes widen. She knew this was Alis's voice, but what surprises her was how the message was transmitted—it wasn't through speech or text but instead telepathy.
>
> Given her past lives, she knew what telepathic communication was like. However, this particular sensation was new to her. The way the voice pierced her mind reminded her of spiders creeping into her skull. Even if she knew who was speaking, she couldn't help but admit the sensation was quite eerie.
>
> Solana glances around the lab to see Vic and Alis in proximity. She turns towards Alis with a curious expression.
>
> In response, Alis gives her a faint, wry smile.
>
> `Guilty.`
>
> Solana gently smiles in return.

---

> "Thanks for the tea!" she says. "It's good." Silently, she adds, `I must admit, I'm curious what's in it. It's quite minty and sweet.`
>
> "I'm glad you enjoy it," Alis replies. `I would tell you what it is, but I would need to induct you into Oneiros first.`
>
> Solana pauses and stifles a laugh. `Oh dang it, you too?`
>
> Alis deals Solana a soft, quizzical look. `Excuse me?`
>
> Solana smiles. `You're not the first Vic to ask me to decipher your mysterious tea,` she relays. `Not that that's a bad thing! I'm interested in figuring out what's in it, but it just means I might've already seen similar puzzles already.`
>
> `I see.`
>
> [`Your tea doesn't taste like an oolong,  though,`](../2022-h2/2022-11-11_icebreaker-041-042-043.md) `so your answer is probably different from the one Vic had,` Solana says.
>
> She adds, `I guess that means we'll need to check Oneiros out.`
>
> Alis looks curiously at her. `Are you perhaps proposing...?`
>
> `That we visit Oneiros? Well, I can't say I haven't been curious about it!`
>
> Alis grows quiet for a moment, then replies, `...If you are truly interested, I suppose I could make arrangements for you and Armin. I don't suppose you would be able to spare time this evening?`
>
> This evening, was it? Solana looked forward to what Alis had planned.
>
> `Let's do it,` she says.

---

> Shortly after, a portal opens in front of Solana.
>
> It was Vic.
>
> "...You realize I can _see_ you two talking?" he says.
