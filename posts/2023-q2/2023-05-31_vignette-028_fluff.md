# Vignette 028 – Fluff

> Solana finds herself tumbling through the sky.
>
> As she falls, she passes through clouds of scarlet, lavender, and azure. Noting the strange colors of clouds, she knew she wasn't home, but she couldn't quite pin down where she was.
>
> She glances around, looking for something to break her fall. There were towering cloud-like structures around her, but not much else.
>
> Well, if video games taught her anything, she would be fine.

---

> Suddenly, a portal opens underneath Solana. Upon being thrust through the portal, a force starts tugging her the other direction. Her freefall gradually slows until she was weightless mid-air. Then, she starts moving the opposite direction, until her fall is broken by a soft, springy surface.
>
> If she had to guess, she had just been portaled onto an firm, fluffy cloud.
>
> She then notices what else was on the cloud.
>
> Alis stood over her, gold eyes gracing her with a sort of odd fascination. loomed over her. Solana's frame tenses.
>
> Alis extends a hand towards her.
>
> Solana holds her breath.
>
> Alis keeps his hand outstretched, waiting silently for a response.
>
> Solana exhales, then extends her hand in return. With a heft, Solana hobbles to her feet.
>
> "Welcome to the Mental Plane," Alis says.

---

> Solana looks again at the vibrant, towering clouds. In the past, she had lives who encountered similar settings in the Dream World. Considering who she was speaking to, she could believe this was a metaphysical world.
>
> She notices the portal lingering overhead, then turns and glances around.
>
> As Solana looks around, Alis tilts his head.
>
> "You seem confused," he states.
>
> Solana nods. "I saw the portal, so I guess I expected to see Vic nearby."
>
> "Ah," Alis replies. "The ability to bridge two locations in the Mental Plane is also granted to the administrator of Oneiros. I'm sorry to disappoint."

---

> Solana seemed to be focusing on anything but Alis's reply. In particular, she inspected herself. Instead of her normal outfit, she was dressed in a long, traditional-looking Arcturian coat lined with cotton, dyed with floral patterns. She had never seen a coat like this before.
>
> She assumes the outfit was a change triggered by Oneiros. Considering this, a light switches on in her mind.
>
> Now she turns to Alis. "Hey..." she says, eyebrows furrowed. "Don't tell me you're actually Vic masquerading as Alis?"
>
> Looking aside, she adds, "...That would be a very Vic thing to do."
>
> To that, the man in front of her tosses a shrug. "Would you believe any answer of mine as pure truth?"
>
> Solana thinks for a moment, before deciding to approach him.
>
> "Well, if I can't believe anything you _say_..."
>
> She pulls him into a fiercely tight hug.
>
> The next moment, she finds herself hugging empty space, with Alis inexplicably three meters away.
>
> "...Only Clementine has that privilege," he mutters. He glances aside, a flustered expression on his face.
>
> Yep, that was definitely Alis.

---

> `Solana, you're too clever.`
>
> Shortly after Alis blinked away from her, a portal opens to her left.
>
> A kitsune emerges from it. Its coat was brilliant snow-white, and its eyes were vibrant blue. It—no, _he_ had a red scarf tucked around his neck.
>
> The kitsune strolls up and sits in front of Solana, his tails folded neatly.
>
> Solana's eyes swell.
>
> It was funny how past lives worked; she had never seen a kitsune like this before, yet her heart ached with nostalgia.

---

> The kitsune glances over at Alis, then at Solana.
>
> `We had a plan, you know,` the kitsune relays. `Alis would have introduced me to you, only it would have been ambiguous which Armin you had met until—`
>
> The kitsune then pauses, tilts its head, and looks at her. `Er, Solana?`
>
> Solana stares widely at the kitsune. She blinks, and her expression softens. "Oh, sorry Vic," she says. "It's just... it's been a while since you've assumed this form, hasn't it?"
>
> The kitsune swishes his tails around. `Ah yes, you haven't seen it before, have you? Not in your current state, at least.`
>
> Solana shakes her head.

---

> The kitsune lifts a forepaw and wiggles his toes. `I suppose, considering your other companions, it makes sense you would be enamored with this form.`
>
> Solana nods her head fervently.
>
> `...You are suppressing the urge to pounce on me.`
>
> "Just barely," Solana says, beaming.
>
> The kitsune looks for Alis, instead finding empty space where he last was. The kitsune takes a short sigh, looks at Solana, and nods.
>
> Without a second thought, Solana springs onto the kitsune and buries her face in his fluff.

---

> As Solana was snuggling the kitsune, he grumbles, `This was all _his_ idea, you know. He said you needed an icy kitsune to identify the tea.`
>
> "_Alis_," Solana says. [What a tsundere.](../2023-q1/2023-01-09_vignette-018_fan-terminology.md)
>
> The kitsune snuggles in return. `I suppose we can forgo any pretense of misdirection and just enjoy a pleasant evening of puzzle-solving.` He looks at her. `What say you, Solana?`
>
> A warm smile grows on Solana's face. "I'd love nothing more than that."
