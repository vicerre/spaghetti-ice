# Rendition 082 – Deliberate (2025-07-03)

## Overview

I've always admired the prolific artists on the internet—the ones that can churn out webcomic pages and animations at a breakneck pace.

In contrast to these artists, I am fairly inefficient. It takes me many hours to put out what artists of other calibers can put out in one. In noticing this, I decided to perform an exercise in drawing efficiently, using Vic as my subject.

## Design notes

Much of my inefficiency stems from two places:

- Originally, I used a mouse and then a non-display tablet to control the cursor on my monitor. This meant that I was never drawing directly where my canvas was, so I had to develop my workflow with this limitation in mind.
- Between changing requirements and community feedback, one of the art projects I devoted time to required me to account for constant revisions in my workflow.

These factors led to a workflow where I would draw haphazardly first and edit later.

As of writing, neither of the prior circumstances is required. As a result, I tested a change to my workflow where I worked more deliberately in creating the linework and composition when drawing.
