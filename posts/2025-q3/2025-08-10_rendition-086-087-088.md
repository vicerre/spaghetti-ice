## Overview

- A ["Hello, world!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) animation of Vic rendered in Adobe Animate.
- A character head turn cycle rendered in Clip Studio Paint EX.

## Design notes

- These exercises don't represent my first dance with animation. However, these exercises _do_ represent the first time I approached the subject with a degree of scientific rigor.
- With this exercise, I finally found a reason for drawing the sphere as the starting point for drawing the head. In laying out the locations of the spheres, I was able to use them as reference points in perspective for where other body parts should lie.
- Even with significant simplification, my characters' hairstyles are painful to adapt into an animated format:
  - In animating Vic's hair, I had to employ a [Cheated Angle](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatedAngle) as it transitioned from a side-facing angle to a back-facing angle.
  - In animating Alis's hair, I animated it at half the frame rate as the rest of his design.
- The more I learn about animation, the more I learn the following: animation is as much about keeping things still as it is about making things move. It is the interplay of "stop" vs. "go" that gives animation its, well, animated effect.
