Solana: Hey Alis! Check out this cool optical illusion I found.

Solana: It's really weird how the lines in this picture look bent.

Solana: Can you tell me more about how it works?

Alis: Certainly, Solana.

---

Alis: ...In other words, in isolating the differential between regions of light and dark, the visual cortex registers the edges of this signal separately of its fundamental form.

Solana: I see! Now I understand why the lines in those optical illusions looked bent. Thanks for explaining.

Caption: Is now considering zebras with psychic powers
