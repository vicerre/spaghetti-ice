## Overview

Recently, Alis has accumulated a number of inspirations and themes, enough that I felt inspired to draw them out. This image is a sketch in which I depict these inspirations as an "ultimate form" style of design.

## Design notes

Theme inspirations:

- _deus ex machina_
- edelweiss
- goldenrod
- horn and ivory
- ivory tower
- white rook

Design inspirations:

- [Ao Guang](https://ne-zha.fandom.com/wiki/Ao_Guang) (_Ne Zha 2_)
- [Chronos](https://hades.fandom.com/wiki/Chronos?file=Portraits_Chronos_01.png) (_Hades II_)
- [Colress](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Colress#/media/File:Colress_SM_concept_art.png) (_Pokémon Sun and Moon_)
