# Rendition 009 – Painting (2021-11-16)

<img src="assets/2021-11-16_image-013.png">

## Overview

Since I've upgraded to Adobe Photoshop CC, I've able to use the full extent of [Kyle T. Webster's megapack](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/brushes.html). I browsed through the megapack and gave the following a whirl:

- Kyle's Concept Brushes – All-Purpose Blend
- Kyle's Inkbox – Brush Beauty 2

Since I was painting with these brushes, I experimented with other steps in the painting process.

## Design notes

- In prior works, I lowered the saturation of colors the farther the surface was from the light source. For the skin tone here, however, I increased the saturation. This made the skin color look more vibrant. Afterward, I sampled the HSL values of each color to understand how these values changed as I went from light to dark.
- From watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk6nJPVkVB8) from Levi Neha, I learned that I front-load my art process. This leads me to becoming frustrated when my art doesn't come out well early in the process, when the steps that "make art look good" are part of post-processing. In future works, I will need to be more patient with works in progress that fall below my expectations.
- As a result, I added some post-processing effects as a way to tie the image together after painting is complete. As a starting point, I used the following resources:
  - [DanLuVisiArt – THE GRAIN TUTORIAL](https://www.deviantart.com/danluvisiart/art/THE-GRAIN-TUTORIAL-157135405)
  - [Sharpen Images in Photoshop with the High Pass filter](https://www.photoshopessentials.com/photo-editing/sharpen-high-pass/)
  - [Sinix Design – 7 Tips for Post-Processing your Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIZwUsAnRtg)
  - For this piece, I used a High Pass, Vibrance, and Noise filter, but I'll experiment with other effects in the future.
