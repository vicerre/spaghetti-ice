# Meta 002 – Blog Name (2021-07-02)

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. -- Phil Karlton (allegedly)

As it turns out, naming things is a hard thing when it comes to blogs as well!

When giving titles to art, I've always went with a literal descriptor for what the art entailed. In contrast, Tumblr blog names tend to be more abstract and memorable rather than literal. This was a conundrum I had to figure out when starting this blog.

Ice seems to be a recurring theme with Vicerre, so I used that as a starting point when thinking about blog names.

"Vexations" was the first name that came to mind, being a rather unique word that was inspired by one of Vicerre's character inspirations. It has a similar phonetic quality to "Vicerre" as a name—"vexations" use fricatives like "v" and "s", which matches Vicerre's "v" and "s". That being said, I felt like the word "vexations" didn't have too much going for it. It literally refers to "confusions", which doesn't go with too much.

The next one I tried was "Strawberry Ice". Vicerre acquired a taste for strawberries when he was altered in the Dream World, and strawberries became a recurring theme, so "Strawberry Ice" carries several layers of meaning behind it. Unfortunately, a quick search on Google led me to find out that "Strawberry Ice" also apparently refers to drug paraphernalia, which I did not want as an association. I also didn't want to call the blog "Strawberry Ice Cream" since I wanted to emphasize ice, not ice cream.

That being said, the name did lead me to the blog name I ended up going with to start. "Strawberry Ice" itself was a riff on "Spaghettieis", an ice cream dish made to look like spaghetti. In place of tomato sauce, Spaghettieis uses strawberry sauce, so it retains the strawberry connection of the previous name. "Spaghetti" is a memorable word that tends to be associated with messiness—for instance, in the phrase "spaghetti code"—which is probably appropriate for the mess of things I post about. I went with the English translation of the term, since I didn't like how the "iei" vowel cluster broke up readability.

And there you have it, the name for this blog as of 2021-07-02. Now to master cache invalidation.
