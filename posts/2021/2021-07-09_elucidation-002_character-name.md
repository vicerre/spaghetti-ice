# Elucidation 002 – Vicerre's Name

When I create names for my characters, inspiration comes most easily when I look for words and sounds that can provide a second layer of meaning. For a name like "Armin Vicerre", this was my thought process:

- One of Vicerre's original motives was a desire to play God. Given _Pokémon_'s influence in that setting, I drew inspirations from the closest God equivalent in the franchise, Arceus. This was broken up into syllables of **Ar**min Vi**ce**rre.
- I expanded "Ar-" into "Armin", since "Armin" was a punchy name that kept the growly English "ɹ" sound.
- I added the fricative "v" and the affricate "ʧ" to give "Vicerre" a hiss-like quality to it, befitting a sinister sort of person.
- I reaffirmed the "ɹ" sound from the given name in "Vicerre".
- I dropped the "-us" ending, since I tend to associate it with Latin names, which I did not want to suggest here.
- As an added bonus, "Vicerre" sounds similar to "vicious", which has character implications.
