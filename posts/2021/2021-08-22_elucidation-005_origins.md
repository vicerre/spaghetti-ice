# Elucidation 005 – Vicerre's Origins

In the early 2010s, I was part of a Pokémon community called [The Sky Temple of Lugia and Articuno](https://www.tumblr.com/theskytemple). This community had an IRC server, with a big part of IRC being free-form role-plays. I spent much of my teenage years on this IRC server creating characters and playing with them with other members of the community. Among these characters was what would become Vicerre. He was conceived sometime before April 20, 2013 as a one-off antagonist, but he ended up surviving past this purpose.

When it comes to designing characters for role-plays, you need to write them in a way such that they fit the medium of their work. When it comes to antagonists, you need to put even more care into their design, since they are the ones who drive the plot of the role-play.

- The primary goal of role plays is to ensure a fun experience for everyone involved, so you want your character to be compelling to play as, and you want other player characters to feel like they have agency and purpose against this character.
- At the same time, since you don't have creative control over the other player characters, you are limited in what relationships you can form between the antagonist and other characters.
- One additional motivation for how I designed this character was my well-being at the time. In a time when I found real life exhausting, role-playing was a form of escapism for me. I could indulge in fantasies in a safe environment with other people who supported me.

The primary inspirations behind this character's motives came from the circumstances of my teenage years. I felt powerless in those times, so the character took the form of someone who could control other characters. At the same time, I prided myself on academics, so he became a [Wicked Cultured](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured) character. With those factors in mind, I created a backstory for this character. In a nutshell, he was an embittered scientist-type person who sought to end all conflict in this world by assimilating everyone's consciousness and ascending as their god. Through heroic willpower, our protagonists would be able to break free from his control and defeat him! That was the beginning to the character now known as Vicerre.

Of course, role-plays rarely follow the plot you've set up. Other people have their own ideas on where to take the story, and Vicerre's character went in a different direction from that. How this change occurred is another story in of itself. For now, you can see what parts of Vicerre's original concept have stayed and which have evolved since then.
