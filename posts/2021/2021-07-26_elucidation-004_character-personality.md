# Elucidation 004 – Vicerre's Personality

## Overview

When people ask about what sort of personality Vicerre has, I find it difficult to give a single answer. He is a character that I've taken through many events, so he has undertaken much character development.

As of this post, I can break down his characterization into the following phases and give a brief history on each phase:

### Phase 1 (Armin, circa 2013)

> "All trust does is set you up for suffering when that trust is inevitably broken. Wouldn't you rather optimize out that pain of the equation?"

Vicerre originally started out as a one-off antagonist for a role play, so he was designed as an unpleasant character. Even after the protagonists "tamed" him, he was still far from heroic.

At that time, he went by his given name, Armin, and he still refers to his original personality by this name.

Descriptors:

- Abrasive
- Acerbic
- Callous
- Cynical
- Devil-may-care
- Detached
- Distant
- Lack of empathy
- Mechanical
- Misanthropic
- Proud
- Ruthlessly pragmatic
- Self-destructive
- Stiff
- Unsettling

### 1.1

> For as long as he remembered, he had never known anyone who was so... adamant about befriending him. He looks at Ishiro, a brief, disbelieving smile on an otherwise-stoic face.
>
> "You really don't take 'no' for an answer, do you?"

The protagonists wanted to help him rather than defeat him outright, so he was eventually forced to reveal his motives.

Descriptors:

- Guarded
- Moody
- Severely embittered

### 1.2

> Zada dully looks out of her prison towards Ishiro. Her horns were freezing over from the last time she tried chipping away at the ice shell. "Please... making others suffer won't solve anything," she says to Armin.
>
> "I don't really care," Armin replies, his eyes averted towards her. His attention was on Ishiro, who was staring coldly at him. Armin grins. "I just find it so _fun_ seeing you squirm."
>
> One moment later, a spike of ice forms beneath Zada, twisting its way upwards and driving its way through her chest. Ishiro's irises shrink to pinpoints, and he visibly fights back tears.

In addition, when he became corrupted by the Exogeny, he became significantly more unhinged.

Descriptors:

- Bloodthirsty
- Callous
- Caustic
- Conceited
- Cruel
- Grandiose
- Indulgent
- Mad with power
- Megalomaniacal
- Sadistic
- Twisted
- Uninhibited

### Phase 2 (Vicerre, circa 201?)

> "I know, those portals would be a great way to catch up, but you shouldn't use them. They're called 'Corridors of Darkness', and they'll corrupt your soul if you use them."
>
> He pauses, glancing aside. "No, I don't know why I know this, but really, I _am_ trying to help."

The character known as Vicerre was created in the Dream World. He was formed from Armin's deep-seated self-loathing and desire to have someone better replace him.

Since Vicerre was created with [redacted's] soul fragment and lacks access to Armin's memories, his personality differs significantly from Armin's.

Descriptors:

- Affable
- Benign
- Curious
- Excitable
- Fascinated
- Friendly
- Inquisitive
- Morbid sense of humor
- Nonchalant
- Pleasant

### Phase 3 (Reconciliation, circa 2016)

> Suddenly, a familiar portal opens underneath the kitsune, catching her and throwing her back up, decelerating her fall. Another set of portals bring the kitsune back to solid land, next to Ishiro.
>
> Vicerre's stares at the portal lingering in the air. That was one of Armin's abilities.
>
> Ishiro looks at the portal, and then at the person standing next to him. "Armin...?" he asks. "You saved her?"
>
> Vicerre's gaze remained unchanged. "...I did," he says. "But please... don't call me that."

Armin's personality and memories flooded back to Vicerre after he was forced to draw on Armin's abilities. At first, Vicerre treated Armin like a monster to keep suppressed, while at the same time, he wanted to atone for his actions.

Descriptors:

- Cautious
- Contemplative
- Death-seeking
- Grateful
- Guilt-ridden
- Modest
- Reluctant
- Sorrowful
- Wistful

### 3.1

> "Ah, Ishi! What brings you over to my place today? I don't suppose you have another experiment you'd be interested in partaking in? Go make yourself comfortable—I'll go make tea."

When the other characters in the role play were able to convince Vicerre that they consider him redeemed, he was able to find peace with himself and accept the parts of himself he shunted to Armin. Vicerre brought Armin's clever nature back as a lighthearted way of pushing the protagonists along.

Descriptors:

- Droll
- Genial
- Mild
- Playful
- Thoughtful
- Trollish, when he feels like it
- Wry

### Phase 4 (Vic, 2022-10-13 – present)

> "It's funny, isn't it?" he says.
>
> He turns toward Solana. For a moment, he turns his gaze away, lost for what to say next. But then, he focuses on her. He lifts a hand and gently brushes her hair away from her face.
>
> "...I give you all of these puzzles to solve, and you solve the one I didn't even realize I had."

The addition of Solana triggers a dramatic shift in his personality. As he engages with Solana, he loosens up significantly. Eventually, his characterization comes full circle; he finds acceptance with himself, and he sheds his icy persona.

During this phase of Vicerre's journey, other characters start referring to him predominantly as "Vic".

- Lived-in
- Self-conscious
- Thoughtful
- Unconventional
