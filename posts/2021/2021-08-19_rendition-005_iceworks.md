# Rendition 005 â€“ Iceworks

<img src="assets/2021-08-19_image-008.png">

## Overview

I had a good weekend from 2021-08-07 to 2021-08-08! Generally, I've been languishing from the COVID-19 lockdown, but I was able to meet with a friend earlier that week, who gave me a spark of productivity. At the same time, I received the video ["How To Beat Writer's Block"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WzAjg8j2UI) from Austin McConnell in my YouTube recommendations, and this video motivated me to practice more art. From there, I checked out the first five episodes of Marco Bucci's ["10 Minutes to Better Painting"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLmXZMqb_9sbNLM83NrM005vRQHw1yTKn) series, which I had been meaning to study. From there, I decided to practice the techniques discussed by painting a scene from one of Vicerre's role-plays.

## Story notes

This scene is from late in Vicerre's arc, where he has dropped his ruthless pragmatism and instead has put more attention into the creative arts. There's no reason why he needed to put on a fireworks display, except as a way to delight his friends. Besides, isn't it a sight to behold?

## Design notes

In creating this painting, I practiced the skill of guiding the viewer's eye. This is a skill I had previously known in character design through concepts like "lines of action" and "levels of detail", but I hadn't learned these rules in the context of painting. However, since I had learned about these rules in the context of painting, I tried applying them.

The rules I applied include:

- The 80/20 rule. This is a rule that states that 80% of your drawing investment into should be on 20% of the piece. I had previously learned about the rule before, but I was reluctant to follow it. I thought that leaving the parts of a painting "incomplete" meant that I'd be leaving the painting incomplete by extension. Marco Bucci's video series enlightened me on how incompleteness can be used as an artistic technique; by leaving parts of a painting incomplete, you can draw the viewer's attention to the parts that _are_ complete. In addition, leaving parts incomplete lets the viewer "fill in the gaps", which lets the viewer engage more actively with the painting ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzCGP6kUvLU)). Here are a few example of how I applied this rule in this painting:
  - I painted the Ninetales and fireworks with sharper lines and with a higher amount of detail than that of the surrounding environment, drawing the viewer's attention towards those elements.
  - I left parts of the painting out of focus, such as the top of the tree and the shrubs in the foreground, as well as the land far away in the background.
- Shape and color detail. In past paintings, I generally shaded shapes the way they would appear in reality. Using reality as a guide is a great place to start, but I learned that you need to do more to make art more readable:
  - By blending areas of shadow into one shape, you can simplify regions of your painting, letting the viewer fill in the missing detail ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nap7dwHjD9Y)). In this painting, I blurred the shadow between the Ninetales, tree, and ground.
  - How much distinction there is between colors can indicate cohesion or contrast between those parts of the painting ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LhcNbFMkTw)). In this painting, I used similar colors to tie the elements in the foreground together, while I used a different set of colors for the background, creating a separation. In addition, I painted the scene such that the color of the fireworks and the illumination produced by the fireworks ties the foreground and background regions together.
  - The amount of color detail an area has can also guide the viewer's attention. Areas of high saturation and brightness tend to draw more attention than areas of low saturation and brightness. Areas with a wider range of colors tend to appear more vivid and detailed, even if the objects there wouldn't normally be this colorful in real life. In this painting, I added orange and purple to areas like the Ninetales, tree trunk, stone, and foliage, where the painting would look flat otherwise. In contrast, the background uses muted hues.

## Miscellaneous notes

- I drew Vicerre as a Ninetales here, since I thought that he looked more picturesque in nature this way.
- By closing off the left side of the canvas, the tree on the left frames the piece and keeps the user's attention inwards.
- I was inspired by night-sky objects such as the Pleiades in rendering these fireworks.
- The fireworks could have more personality. If I weren't practicing other concepts of art, I would think about how to make these fireworks look more interesting.
