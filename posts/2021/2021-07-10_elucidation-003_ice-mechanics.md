# Elucidation 003 â€“ Ice Mechanics (2022-07-30)

## Overview

Vicerre gained the ability to grow ice after he was corrupted by the Exogeny. Originally, he used this ability exclusively for the purpose of freezing and skewering those who objected to him. After he was purged of this corruption, though, he started using this ability for other, more practical purposes, such as playing the piano.

One consideration with designing how this ability worked was this character's pragmatism. I'd often ask myself why Vicerre couldn't, say, freeze someone from the inside out to beat the next antagonist, so I had to establish rules and limitations.

## Story notes

- He can only grow ice in an area around 100 meters in radius.
- He can only grow ice from a physical, macroscopic surface, much like how you would need a physical surface to grow a tree.
- He needs to have active focus on an area to grow ice on it, but once it's grown, it will stay there on its own.
- There's no limit to the amount of ice he can grow, but he can only focus on a small amount of mass at once, roughly the size of a young tree.
- Once the ice has finished growing, it will stay there until either he dismisses it or it dissipates on its own.
- He cannot put more detail into the ice grown than what can be seen with the naked eye.
- He cannot change ice that isn't grown by him.
- The ice he grows is created from nothing, and when dissipated, it returns to nothing.
