# Meta 003 – Searching Music by Sound

When I wrote down which songs inspired Vicerre's leitmotif style, I knew the names of most of the tracks. However, I didn't know the name of the Bach piece, and it took me an hour to find its name from the music alone. I knew the following properties about it:

- key: D
- mode: minor
- meter: triple
- notes for the first 12 measures of the piece
- It was in a piano book with a yellow cover

I tried multiple music search engines like Google, Musipedia, Shazam, Soundhound, and Themefinder, but none of them produced relevant results.

When that failed, I started looking up piano books with yellow covers, and I eventually found what I believe to be the correct catalog—Schirmer's Library of Musical Classics. I knew that the book was not very thick, so it was unlikely to be one of their giant anthologies. Instead, I looked at [this description](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/4075121322626751788) for "Selected Piano Masterpieces – Intermediate Level" and looked up every piece listed on YouTube. While the track I was looking for was not in that book, the pieces listed gave me a hint. Going by my memory, the piece I was looking for was likely to be composed by one of the composers listed. The word "Prelude" seemed familiar, so I searched for "Bach Prelude in D Minor" and, to my surprise, the first result was the piece I was looking for.

The lesson I took away here is that, despite our advancements in technology, we haven't been able to create a music search engine that could handle a case like Bach's Prelude in D Minor (BWV 935).
