# Meta 001 â€“ Good day!

After almost twelve years, I've decided to open a second account dedicated to art exercises that don't have a place on my original account. I expect this account to be a character art blog, but we'll see how this account evolves.

The character you will see being drawn as a vehicle for art exercises is a character I have named Armin Vicerre. He's the first human character I developed for storytelling purposes. He wasn't intended to stay for so long, but he has, so he's my primary human character now. That being said, he's a character that has had a long, long history by now, so I won't summarize him right here.

Thank you for visiting my page!
