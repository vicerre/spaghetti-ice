# Vignette 061 – Warm Touch

> It was 16:34, and Solana was in Vic's bedroom, one hand pressed against Vic's arm while she and Vic sat atop the mattress.
>
> "Ever since you came back," she had said, "I noticed something different about you," she says. "I thought it might've been the change of seasons, but I had to make sure."
>
> She presses down and runs her fingers along the arm's length, then turns her eyes up towards Vic.
>
> "You're not cold anymore."

> Vic, meanwhile, was frozen for another reason entirely.

> Solana's touch was warm and supple, unfamiliar yet long-lost. It was as if his ears were clogged and only now he could experience music for the first time; or perhaps, it was as if he gained a new sense altogether. Out of his twenty-odd years of existence, he can't recall a single instance where he felt physically comfortable around another human being—not even as a child seeking his mother's affection.

> With that, he briefly wonders whether this was [the reason he wasn't able to access his abilities over ice recently.](2023-10-01_icebreaker-098.md)

> His next action is automatic. He fumbles for Solana's spare hand, clasping it with his own like a child playing hand-games. His fidgeting then slows to tenuous levels, as though Solana were a wild rabbit, and she would scamper away if he twitched too suddenly.

> He then notices Solana's gaze—bright red stars piercing his eyes and reaching for his soul. Written on it was a mix of emotions—familiarity, fondness, and assurance, to wit—and in addition, perhaps, hints of her own bygone aches.
>
> Solana holds her breath, waiting for Vic to speak his mind.
>
> Vic shoots her a pleasantly irritated expression. Without much thought, he pulls Solana towards her, then presses his nose against Solana's cheek—a gesture small, delicate, and intimate.
>
> As though Solana had been biding all this time, she reciprocates.

> [Usually, Vic disliked the idea of being a kitsune. After all, shed fur and the lack of opposable thumbs made daily life all the less convenient.](../2023-q2/2023-06-04_vignette-030_animorphism.md) However, he wishes the opposite now, at least for this moment; he wants nothing more than to curl up on the bed, head cradled gently in Solana's lap, spared from human obligations.

> ...He supposes there's nothing stopping him from doing so anyway.
