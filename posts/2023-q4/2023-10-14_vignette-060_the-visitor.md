# Vignette 060 – The Visitor

> Alis was expecting a visitor today.
>
> He found the idea foreign; after all, he never invited anyone over to his place—much less invite people at all. The people who _did_ knock on his front door were maintenance folks or, occasionally, [an alternate universe analog requesting a round of chess.](../2023-q1/2023-01-29_vignette-021_check.md)
>
> His eyes rolled across the main room of his apartment. The space was still packed from edge to edge with the standard miscellany of neurological devices, and a single chair presided over the space.
>
> Whenever Vic had visitors—whether in the lab or his own apartment—he offered them a cup of tea from his collection. Ever since he learned of Solana's and Vic's tastes, he stashed a few additional flavors in the kitchen. Yet, his collection could hardly be considered a variety. He didn't know if his visitor enjoyed tea at all, or if they experienced thirst. He wasn't sure what to expect from his visitor besides what Vic told him, and what Vic told him was very little.
>
> Like Vic, his place wasn't exactly established with visitors in mind. Yet, also like Vic, it would seem his place would find visitors regardless.
>
> A part of him knows his visitor isn't here to antagonize him, and the remaining parts trust the idea. With any luck, they could spend time outside 680 49th Street—a well-hidden café or simply a tour around Firenze's many age-beaten plazas, perhaps. It was simply a matter of getting the message across.
>
> It was now noon, and there was a knock on the door.

> Alis wasn't sure what to make of the sight beyond the bounds of his home. It was a figure he could ostensibly call human-like, yet nothing about it seemed physically human. It was as though space were blotted out with ink, and white pen had been scrawled to suggest the trace of existence. It was less so a human-like figure as it was a rip in spacetime given human form.
>
> He is unflustered by the sight; after all, Oneiros offered him the chance to distort reality through the Mental Plane, and spacetime distortions were the subject of study in his analog's universe. He briefly wonders if those spacetime distortions would find their way here, but he dismisses the idea as unfounded.
>
> His intrigue gives way to classic Vicerre fascination. It's within the same moment he wishes to study his visitor, to understand the otherwise-inexplicable phenomenon outside his doorstep. He wants to ensnare his visitor with Oneiros and delve into their physiology and psychology—only to find that Oneiros doesn't register this figure as having a functional nervous system, much less an intact mind.
>
> Knowing who the visitor is, however, he quells the urge. In the best case, they would entertain his interests and offer him a glimpse into their existence. In the worst case, any attempt at researching the subject would lead to madness.
>
> Suddenly, it dawns on Alis how Vic acquired his eccentric mannerisms.

---

> Without missing a beat, Alis opens with a faint smile and a droll flick of his eyebrows.
>
> "I don't have the _faintest_ idea who you might be," he confesses. "I can't imagine who would appear under the guise of creation drawn to life."
>
> His message is glib yet cordial at the same time. Given his tone and overall mannerisms, he treats his visitor like an old friend, the kind he would never fully complement but still finds value in spending time with regardless.
>
> This makes sense, considering I'm the visitor.
