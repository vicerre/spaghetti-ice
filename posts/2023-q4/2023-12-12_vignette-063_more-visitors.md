# Vignette 063 – More Visitors

> Somehow, Alis was expecting more visitors this afternoon.
>
> It was only three months ago he was personally responsible for nearly killing off a parallel dimension and the residents within. In that aspect, Alis thought himself no more deserving of their favor than any other extradimensional monster.
>
> Despite this, a particular pair from that dimension had looked to schedule an afternoon this weekend at his place for—what else—board games, ice cream, and idle discussion.
>
> Of the two, Armin offered a pretense for the address. "Firenze offers a better climate this time of year for ice cream," he had said.
>
> While ostensibly true, Alis knew Armin's statement was less than candid. Even before Armin had elaborated, Alis had deduced no fewer than two further pretenses for the visit, both of which inquired of him as the venerable co-conspirator.
>
> He didn't need Armin to elaborate on his agenda, though.
>
> He didn't need to deduce it, even.
>
> By the time Armin extended his proposal, Alis had already made up his mind.
