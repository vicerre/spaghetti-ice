# Vignette 062 – Symptoms

> Solana was in her lab chair when something taps her shoulder.
>
> The sensation was unexpected. The touch wasn't cool and firm like Vic's fingers, and it wasn't soft and squishy like Clementine's nose. Instead, it was hard and smooth—ordinary and inorganic.
>
> Solana looks over her shoulder to find Vic standing over her, looking back at her with mild curiosity. In his hand was a long, cylindrical flask, its trunk made of glass and its ends capped with steel.
>
> Unlike the other flask she knew, this one still had a function. It was intact, for one, and it was empty—no fluid suspension or swirling starlight on the inside. It was a container seeking a use.

> "If I may ask, Solana," Vic says, "you got Arclight on you while I was absent, didn't you?"
>
> Solana nods.
>
> "Has it been bothering you at all?" he says. "Have you noticed any changes to your irritation or stress levels, or perhaps disturbing thoughts? We can always synthesize the neutralizing agent if so."
>
> Solana looks curiously at Vic, then thinks.
>
> After a moment, she responds.
>
> "You know," she states, her voice hovering faintly in the air, "I can't tell."

> "When you were gone," she adds, "I knew I had to take the lead and assume your position if I wanted any chance of getting you back."
>
> Vic gives a short nod in response. "I saw the logs you left on the system," he says. "You did well."
>
> Solana glances at him and smiles softly.
>
> She then looks away. "There's no doubt I was upset you were gone. You're my best friend, after all. You're as important to me as my own heart. I'd be just as upset if someone decided to rip that out of me, you know?"
>
> Vic nods in understanding.

---

> She tilts her head slightly. "But it's natural to be upset and to want to fix things after things go wrong, right?"
>
> She shrugs. "Maybe Arclight amplified or suppressed that reaction. Maybe it didn't. I don't know."
>
> She glances up and smiles gently. "It could also just be I'm just immune to whatever shenanigans you send my way."

---

> Something that feels suspiciously like Vic's nose presses against her hair.
>
> "Well, if that's what we believe," Vic replies, placing the flask aside, "then there's no need to make changes, is there? With or without Arclight, you are, emphatically, still you."
>
> Something that feels like Vic's arms hugs her head.
>
> "Just promise me you won't go mad with power and make plans for world domination?" he says, softly smiling.
>
> Solana's expression becomes one of friendly amusement. Then, she reaches up, ruffling Vic's hair with her fingers.
>
> "I promise."
