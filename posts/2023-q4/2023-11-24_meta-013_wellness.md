# Meta 013 â€“ Wellness

I've been rather well lately.

Over the course of the pandemic, I experienced an increase in spare time. Because of this shift, I could engage in hobbies I could not otherwise.

Since then, life has slowly returned to normal. My spare time diminished, so engagement in those hobbies necessitated additional time and energy investment. As this additional investment induced stress, I needed an activity to balance that stress.

This is where this blog comes in.

Among other purposes, my universe serves as a venue to convert residual stress into creativity. It is my own creation, so it is always available.

Since this blog was founded, I've reduced my stress intake. Furthermore, the ongoing narrative arc of my universe has reached a conclusion. Together, both factors have reduced the need to produce for this blog. In addition, as this blog acts as a hobby, I do not see the need to force content for the sake of content.

Moving forward, I expect the pace and content of blog posts to change. I expect my universe to undergo less narrative progression. Instead, I expect to rely on my universe as the subject of creative exercises. If you would like, you could consider it a return to form, or perhaps the start of a new chapter.

I've been rather well lately.
