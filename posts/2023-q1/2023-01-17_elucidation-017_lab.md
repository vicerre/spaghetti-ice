# Elucidation 017 â€“ Vicerre's Lab

Established after the Dream World arc, Vicerre's lab acts as his base of operations. In this lab, Vicerre designs and produces custom creatures for his clientele. In addition, this is where he manages side projects in his spare time.

The location of the lab is highly confidential. Only Vicerre knows its physical location, and his portals are the only way for guests to gain access.

The lab may or may not be inhabited by a colony of genetically engineered creatures affectionately referred to as ["lab rats"](2023-01-14_illustration-015_lab-rats.md). These creatures are self-sufficient and act as the lab's custodial staff.

At the time of writing, the lab contains the following fixtures:

- A supercomputer. This supercomputer is responsible for modeling bioengineering projects and collecting experiment data. Additionally, the workstation is integrated with nearby equipment. All data on this machine is backed up remotely on a monthly basis.
- A large assortment of bioengineering equipment. These instruments are used in the design, production, and analysis of macro-scale biological systems.
- The interdimensional portal. This is a round, metallic gate three meters in diameter. When configured, it allows passage to and from a target dimension. A barrier sanitizes all matter passing through the portal.
- Backup generators. In the event of a power outage, 80 kW generators activate and supply power to essential equipment for upwards of 30 days.
- A network of HVAC ducts. These ducts serve as ventilation and as a transportation network for the potential lab rats.

In addition, the lab contains the following items:

- 1 coat rack.
- 1 microwave.
- 1 office chair.
- 1 shoe rack.
- 1 teaware cabinet.
- 2 autoclaves.
- 2 centrifuges.
- 2 sinks.
- 3 bioreactors.
- 3 refrigerators. Each refrigerator is held at a different temperature and contains a variety of samples.
- 5 amniotic tanks. The smallest measures 20 centimeters in diameter and 40 centimeters in height. The largest measures four meters in diameter and three meters in height.
- Many potted plants. Some are natural-grown, and some are human-engineered.
