# Illustration 015 – Lab Rats (2023-01-12 – 2023-01-13)

## Overview

I was inspired to give Vic lab rat assistants as a play on the following tropes:

- Rats being used as test subjects in science.
- Mad scientists having enlightened animal minions.
- Disney Princesses having mice as animal companions.

The more I thought about the idea, the more I figured out how Vic would fit these rats within my established canon:

- He implants the necessary intelligence in them so they can fulfill their purpose. However, as he wants to treat them as friends rather than tools, he ensures these rats develop personalities naturally.
- For maneuverability, he augments these rats with wings. He selects bat wings for their biological compatibility.
- He extends the natural lifespan of these rats.
- To prevent any surprises, he ensures these rats are sterile.
- Their body shape is influenced by several factors:
  - These rats are designed to tolerate cool temperatures, as Vic keeps the lab cool to keep utility costs low.
  - These rats need to fly, so their bone density is lower than that of the average rat.
  - These rats need to perform light manual tasks around the lab such as pressing buttons and transporting small pieces of lab equipment, so they need to have an appropriate mass.
- He initially creates four rats, then names the first pair "Mendel" and "Shelley".
- As an initial test, Vic instructs the rats to take down the holiday lights around his apartment.
- Vic tries to donate a pair of rats to Alis. Alis appreciates the sentiment but declines.
- Vic installs pipes around the lab that lead outside so the rats can get fresh air. As a bonus, he can tell people at face value he has rats living in the walls.
