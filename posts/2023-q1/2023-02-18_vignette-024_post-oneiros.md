# Vignette 024 – Post-Oneiros

> Vic lifts his head and interlaces his fingers. "You wish to join Arklight?" he says.
>
> Alis presses his mouth against his folded hands. "I've given it some thought," he says. "This seems to be the most reasonable path forward post-Oneiros. Granted my prior experience, my skills in the biological sciences integrate well with Arklight's goals."
>
> He leans back, sighs, and softly murmurs, "...If I must exist in your shadow, I will embrace the role."

> A short, funny sound escapes Vic's mouth—the sound you make when you want to say something but can't find the right words.
>
> He grimaces. He never meant for Alis to feel overshadowed by him. Reflecting back on his actions, however, he understands why.
>
> ...He thinks, anyway; even if Alis was more similar to him than most, he still considered human behavior to be an inextricable puzzle.
>
> Alis seemed to notice his reaction, as he adds, "Please don't extend any offers of support, Armin. I would appreciate it if I could integrate with broader society through my own means."
>
> Vic looks up, then gives a patient, understanding nod.

> Alis gives a light, pithy shrug. "Consider this collaboration a favor on your behalf; we'll be able to synthesize creatures with a wider set of capabilities, and you'll be able to allocate more time for activities outside the lab."
>
> His face breaks into a thin smile. "And of course, consider the mysteries you could concoct with a second instance of yourself at full capacity."
>
> Ah yes, shenanigans! Those were important for an active mind.
>
> Following Alis's suggestion, Vic can't help but stop and consider the new set of options before him.
>
> He returns his attention towards Alis; Alis seems pleased he was inspired.
