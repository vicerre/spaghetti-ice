The closest thing that comes to a date is [the time Vic took Solana stargazing](https://vicerre.tumblr.com/post/700319346652790784/). Even then, they can't enact any sort of serious romance. They're nerds!

Realistically, they would smell like ordinary humans. However, this is not an entertaining answer.

> Alis: antiseptic and iron
>
> Solana: fox and conditioner
>
> Vic: stale antiseptic and vinegar

# Icebreaker 053

> Your characters are given a grant to build a public art sculpture in your local park. They have a budget of $10,000. What do they make? You cannot embezzle these funds. ([2022-11-28](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1046961694368354314))

[hypothetical]

> Solana: A bronze sculpture of resembling abstract, windswept, and fantastical creatures. If she is given the option to install something more practical, she takes inspiration from [Burr](https://www.tumblr.com/yuiotj/700374109344890880/) and [Charlotte](...) and designs a fountain with seating along the edge.
>
> Vic: Initially delegates to Solana, but is encouraged to try designing something himself. He eventually designs a spire-like sculpture with crystalline shapes jutting out, roughly two stories tall made of PMMA and with a core of iron.
