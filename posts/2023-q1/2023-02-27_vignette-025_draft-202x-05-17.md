> [When you expressed interest in joining Arklight, you stated you felt as though you lived in my shadow.](https://vicerre.tumblr.com/post/709650723785342976/)
>
> At the time, my initial reaction was to object; I enjoy setting my own course, and I did not want to dissuade you from yours. In addition, I understand all too well what it feels like to live in another's shadow. Repeatedly, even.
>
> As I considered the matter, however, I became increasingly reluctant to follow through.
>
> I realized the timing of your arrival was suspect; I was only able to discover your universe after seemingly resolving my own issues. Was the timing truly coincidence, or had the universe set a course for me?
>
> Perhaps you're trying to tell me something.

> A. Vicerre
