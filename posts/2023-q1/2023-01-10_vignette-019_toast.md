# Vignette 019 â€“ Toast

> Solana had been holding an extended conversation with Alis post-meal when Vic slides over two glasses of a fizzy, amber-colored drink.
>
> She stares at the glass. ["Oh right, the cider!" she says.](../2022-h2/2022-12-25_vignette-014_holiday-dinner-prelude.md) She grabs one of the glasses, then enthusiastically taps her fingers along the bowl.
>
> Vic nods. He then turns his attention to Alis.
>
> Alis looks curiously at his glass, then takes it.
>
> Vic sits down next to them, holding a glass of his own. "I'm not exactly planning to give an elaborate toast," he states, "but I thought this might be a good opportunity to get a few words in."
>
> "Alis," he says, "thank you for joining us this evening. All things considered, I enjoyed collaborating with you on tonight's mystery, and I'm grateful for the way things worked out. I look forward to our future collaborations."
>
> Alis nods cordially.
>
> "And Solana," Vic adds, "thank you for being a charitable co-host to our guest and for being a lively participant in tonight's mystery."
>
> Solana bobs her head and smiles.
>
> "Also Vic," she adds, "thank you for being a great host! The food was great, and I had a great time hanging out with you all."
>
> Alis nods to that.
>
> Vic glances away, rubs the tip of his nose, and shows a half-smile.
>
> Afterward, he replies, "Cheers."
