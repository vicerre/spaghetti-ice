# Vignette 020 – Close

> As the russet hue of the twilit sky recedes into the night, Alis once again stands before the interdimensional portal—this time, with Vic and Solana beside him.
>
> "It was nice meeting you, Alis!" Solana says, waving her hand gently, light gleaming in her eyes.
>
> Alis softly dips his head. "Likewise," he replies.
>
> Vic offers Alis a warm expression. "Take care of yourself back in your universe," he tells him.
>
> "Of course," Alis replies.

> For a moment, Alis's eyes brush past Vic and Solana, before they converge again onto Vic.
>
> ["You didn't bring your exotic dessert this time?" he then says,](../2022-h2/2022-11-05_vignette-004_enthralled.md) a droll smile on his face. He seemed, if not disappointed, discerning that Vic would leave such a curiosity unaddressed at the holiday dinner.
>
> All Vic could do is flicker his eyelids.
>
> Moments later, he sputters, "Aha, you didn't notice?"
>
> "Notice...?" Alis implores, his eyebrows lifted.
>
> "The astringent in your ice cream."
>
> "You claim that's derived from larvae and not berries."
>
> Vic stiffly nods.
>
> Alis stares flatly at Vic, then scoffs, faintly smiling.

> "...Before I leave, I should mention," Alis says. "In my universe, scarves are traditionally used as a symbol of engagement."
>
> He gestures to Vic. "Yours suits you quite well."
>
> "Is that right?" Vic replies. "That's rather interesting!"
>
> A moment later, he turns his head slightly as a dog would. "Or..." he adds, "is that simply another fabrication of yours?"
>
> Alis merely shrugs. Stepping through to the other side of the portal, he adds, "You tell me, my dear ice cream connoisseur."
>
> ...Of course Alis wouldn't give him a straight answer.

---

> Vic grumbles to himself. "Oh, fine," he says, "The ice cream thing was a gag. It's just berries mixed with a touch of honey. I gave you a straight answer—now will you—"
>
> "—Goodbye," Alis interjects.
>
> With that, Alis's irises flash gold, and Vic's follow suit. Vic finds himself before the controls of the interdimensional portal, and he's compelled to press a few keystrokes. Upon doing so, the veil of the portal vanishes—and along with that, Alis.
>
> Immediately afterward, Vic's eyes return to their normal color, and after regaining awareness, Vic sighs with exasperation and smiles.
>
> "...Of course."
