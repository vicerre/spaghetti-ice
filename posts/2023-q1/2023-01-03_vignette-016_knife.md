# Vignette 016 – Knife

> [Following introductions with Alis,](../2022-h2/2022-12-28_vignette-015_first-impressions.md) Solana checks with Vic how dinner prep was going.
>
> [Upon reaching the kitchen, she finds him with a honing steel in one hand and a chef's knife in the other. His sleeves were rolled up, and his hands were stained with cranberry sauce.](2023-01-02_illustration-013_knife-honing.md)
>
> She lifts a hand to interrupt him, then says, "Oh, hang on, Vic."
>
> Vic pauses and glances over to her. "What is it?"
>
> She points to the kitchenware in his hands. "What are you doing currently?"
>
> Vic blinks, then displays the two tools. "...Honing a knife to cut the poultry?"
>
> "With your hands stained red like that?" she asks.
>
> Vic reaches for the tap.

---

> Solana presses her hands against her face, then flaps her hands about. "It's not that," she says. "I mean, between the red stains and knife, I think it's funny how murderous you look."
>
> Vic looks at the knife in his hand and lightly chuckles. "Is that right?"
>
> Solana nods.
>
> "Man," she says, sighing, ["I wish you still had your 'headlights'.](../2022-h1/2022-01-03_rendition-014_claws.md) They'd really help you pull off that sinister look even more, you know?"
>
> Vic tilts the knife, then gives Solana a bright look.
>
> "I suppose that could be arranged."

---

> Vic sets the honing steel down on the counter, then turns away from her.
>
> "Don't move," he states.
>
> Solana gives pause. Just then, Vic's tone bore an intensity she hadn't heard before.
>
> He opens a portal and lodges the knife in it.
>
> The other side of the portal opens next to Solana's throat.
>
> Upon feeling the chill of steel next to her throat, Solana finds herself straining to breathe normally. A jolt of panic rushes through her body, and she fights the urge to scream.
>
> When Vic turns around, his irises were that unnatural shade of gold. His headlights had returned.

---

> [Every time Vic's eyes were gold instead of blue, he wasn't himself.](../2022-h2/2022-12-20_vignette-011_alice.md)
>
> When he had them wielding Arclight, he triggered a psionic convolution cascade. That required him to wipe the memories of 100,000 people.
>
> When he had them under the influence of the Exogeny, he took the life of Zada, one of her past life's friends.
>
> But as of a year ago, she had confirmed with Vic that he didn't have access to his headlights, She knew this wasn't something he would deceive her about, either.
>
> What happened since then?

---

> Solana takes a step backwards towards the living room. She glances at the couch, hoping that Alis would notice and snap Vic out of it.
>
> Except Alis was gone. On the side table was the tea they made him, but the man himself had vanished—seemingly without a trace.
>
> The knife inches closer to Solana, and her heart races.
>
> Okay, then, it was time for Plan B.

---

> Solana takes a few deep breaths—just enough to get her nerves under control.
>
> From the knife, she turns her gaze towards Vic. She forces her shoulders to relax, and she heaves a stressed laugh.
>
> "You know, Vic," she says, "you're doing a really good job of scaring me right now."
>
> He gestures with open hands and a slight bow of his head. "Thank you," he replies. He looks at Solana with an odd fascination, those yellow eyes lingering. He extracts the knife from the portal and returns it to the countertop.
>
> Solana takes a deep sigh. She wasn't in any real danger.
>
> "Ah, just one thing, however," he says.
>
> Her lungs feels like they were turning into lead.
>
> "...You shouldn't mistake me for Armin," he says. "Unlike him, I don't exactly hold any particular attachment towards you."
>
> Suddenly, a sharp, burning pain pierces her back.
>
> Solana doubles over.

---

> As suddenly did the pain strike did it vanish. She presses her fingers repeatedly against her back where the pain was, only to discover no wound or drawn blood.
>
> It was as though the entire experience were some sort of painful tactile illusion.
>
> She slowly stands back up.
>
> "Hi Solana," Vic says.
>
> Solana looks in front of her. Vic's eyes were their regular shade of blue, and he had a deeply irritated expression on his face.
>
> Solana presses her hand over her heart and takes some deep breaths. "You're back," she says. "Right?"
>
> Vic briskly nods. "Long story short," he says, "shenanigans got out of hand."
>
> "—Oh, uhm, wait," she interjects.
>
> "—I had no intentions of putting you in any actual danger, and it's my fault for letting the puzzle escalate as much as it did."
>
> "Vic?"
>
> "Excuse me for a moment while I rectify things."
>
> "Vic!"
>
> Vic blinks. "What is it, Solana?'
>
> "...I thought it was fun."
>
> Vic stares intensely at her for a second, then cranes his head forward, eyebrows furrowed. "...I'm sorry, what?"

---

> Solana's heart was still pounding in her chest, but the wave of excitement had subsided.
>
> She gulps, then says, "You don't need to apologize for the past five minutes."
>
> Despite her assurance, Vic's remained skeptical. He still blamed himself for betraying her trust, [and knowing him, he loathed tarnishing his own values.](../2022-h2/2022-09-28_icebreaker-007-008-009.md)
>
> "Well, uh," she explains, "You know how people like to watch scary movies or jump off cliffs for the rush? And you know how some people find that fun? This was the same thing. Kind of." She awkwardly shrugs. "You know, except in a more personal setting."
>
> Not to mention, he must have been scared out of his wits he was losing a dear friend.
>
> She could feel her face getting warm, and she brushes her hair back. "...Besides, I'm the one who mentioned your headlights in the first place. If you want to pin the blame on anyone, it should be me."

---

> Solana stands next to him in silence; all she could do now is give Vic time to process her words.
>
> Several minutes later, Vic blinks and exhales. "...Well, alright then," he mumbles. "We still have dinner to get to." His tone had a slight liveliness to it—although she could tell it was also tinged with irony.
>
> He cautiously approaches Solana, then ruffles her hair with his still-ruddy hands. "There," he says.
>
> Even if she had ruffled his hair multiple times before, this was the first time Vic had done the same to her. Solana had to check Vic's eyes were still blue. Her face continues to burn.
>
> Looking at her dirtied hair and flushed cheeks, he adds, "I dare say red looks good on you."
