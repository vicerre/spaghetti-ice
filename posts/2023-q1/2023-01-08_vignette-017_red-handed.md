# Vignette 017 – Red-Handed

> Solana, Vic, and Alis had seated themselves at the dining table. Vic and Alis sat adjacent to one other, and Solana sat opposite them. A spread of dishes lay between them, and Solana had already pulled some food onto her plate.
>
> "Hey Alis?" Solana asks.
>
> She finishes a bite of partridge, then points the leg bone at Alis. "You had something to do with the knife, didn't you?"
>
> Alis was in the process of carving his own serving. He glances at the dinner knife in his right hand, then at her.
>
> "Whatever do you mean by that?" he murmurs, not even bothering to feign innocence.
>
> Solana muses. "Well," she says, ["when Vic got all scary and held a knife to my throat, you vanished from the living room."](2023-01-03_vignette-016_knife.md)
>
> She squints at him. "Something tells me that's not a coincidence."

> Alis shrugs and resumes carving his serving. "I was absent at the time because I was using the toilet."
>
> Solana notices he wasn't denying the accusation. Knowing Alis's shared history with Vic, Solana guesses he was conspiring with him.
>
> "...When did we tell you where the bathroom was, if that's the case?" she argues.
>
> "Armin told me ahead of time," he states.
>
> Upon hearing his response, Solana's eyebrows rise.

> Alis smiles at her. "You noticed the hint. Excellent."
>
> Solana nods, then turns to Vic. "When Vic was acting weird, the force that possessed him referred to him as 'Armin'." She looks towards Alis. "I don't know anyone who calls him that but you."
>
> Alis dips his head and explains, "Considering my identity, it would be nonsensical to refer to him as myself."
>
> He looks curiously at the red stains in her hair.
>
> "Armin is right, you know—red does look good on you."
