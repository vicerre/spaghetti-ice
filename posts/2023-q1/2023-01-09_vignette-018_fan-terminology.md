# Vignette 018 â€“ Fan Terminology

> "So how were you manipulating Vic?" Solana asks. "Were you using Arclight? ...Some sort of AU equivalent?"
>
> Alis glances at Vic, bemused.
>
> A moment later, Vic speaks up. "Ah! In this universe, 'AU' is fan terminology. It stands for 'alternate universe'. In other words, it refers to entries that are analogous."
>
> Alis firmly nods, then returns his gaze towards Solana. He states, "If that is the question, then I will answer in the positive; I still wield my universe's analog to Arclight."
>
> Solana muses, then says, "Dang, and you used that ability to get us to discover something new about each other."
>
> Alis shrugs. "If that is your interpretation of how events unfolded."

> Solana giggles. "You know, Alis," she says, "has anyone told you you're a total tsundere?"
>
> Alis glances at Vic, eyebrows raised.
>
> "That's also fan terminology," Vic says. "Er, basically, it refers to someone with a cold and aloof exterior belying a soft and fuzzy interior."
>
> "And Solana associates me with this description?"
>
> Vic hesitates briefly, contemplates the answer, then nods.
>
> Alis turns to Solana, looks curiously at her.
>
> Solana smiles engagingly.
>
> He looks away and shrugs. "You can call me whatever you want," he says.
>
> Solana's smile grows into a wide grin; that was a perfect tsundere response from him.
