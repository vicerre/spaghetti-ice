# Vignette 026 â€“ Apprenticeship

- It's Alis's first day at Arklight Limited.
- Alis has already familiarized himself with Arklight's operations at a high level.

---

- Vic asks Alis what his thoughts are on managing operations as a tag team, where they switch between each other on a day-night cycle. He also comments on how this arrangement opens up the possibility of shenanigans.
- Alis is interested in the arrangement.
- Vic gives a brief overview of their work and introduces him to his workstation. He explains how most of the bioengineering process has been virtualized nowadays. Most of the design process is handled through the supercomputer, and physical testing is only performed at the very end.
- Vic shows Alis the rest of the lab and rattles off a summary of how the synthesis process works. He then explains Solana's role in this setup as his reviewer and assistant.
- Alis pauses once they pass by the amniotic tanks.
- Vic notices, then asks if he was thinking about Armin.
- Alis rebuts whether Vic needed to ask.
- One moment later, Alis returns his attention to Vic and asks if he can resume the onboarding process.
- When Vic asks if he's sure, Alis insists he's fine.

---

- Vic messages Solana about whether she'd like to say "hi' to Alis. Solana is interested.
- Shortly after, Solana arrives with Clementine and Nia. She invites Alis to play with them, as they'll be handling magical creatures often.
- Clementine and Nia make excellent distractions while Solana walks Alis through her responsibilities.

---

- It's time for lunch.
- Solana asks Alis if he'd like to eat anywhere particular today, and the three eventually decide on a local Talixian-style eatery.
- Solana explains how she and Vic usually handle lunch, and she asks what would work best with Alis.
- Alis is non-committal and accepts whatever Solana plans usually.

---

- Solana and Vic continue to explain the bioengineering pipeline to Vic.
- Solana explains it's standard if a project takes on the order of weeks or months.
- Vic chimes in that it's also standard for the first several project syntheses to fail as well, and that he shouldn't worry about failing.
- Considering his past experience, Alis finds it confusing how helpful Solana and Vic are being.

---

- Vic comments, "Feel free to ask questions; the work Arklight does isn't exactly common knowledge. ...Or, well, you can probably find an answer if you rummage through one of our heads."
- Alis says he'll stick to asking questions physically, considering how much else passes through Vic's head.
- "Ah... fair enough," Vic responds. "But please, let me know if you need anything from either of us."
- Alis replies accordingly.

---

- The three finish lunch and return to the lab.
- Solana bids farewell for now, as she needs to take Clementine on a walk.

---

- Alis and Vic head to the supercomputer to get started on Alis's first task. Alis already knows the password.
- Upon logging into Vic's profile, he finds his setup a mess.
- Alis wants to organize everything. Vic objects at first, but he relents shortly afterward.
- The two spend time organizing files on the workstation. Along the way, Alis studies everything they encounter.
- A short time later, Alis gets started.
