# Vignette 021 – Check

> There is a knock at Alis's door.
>
> Between the absence of sound at the buzzer and the pattern of rapping, Alis knew immediately who that was. Knowing that, he appreciates his visitor didn't set the coordinates of the interdimensional portal to the _inside_ of the apartment this time.

---

> Alis cracks open the door, peering through the opening. As expected, on the other side of the door was Armin.
>
> He immediately notices the laptop bag Armin wore over one arm, then looks at him with amused exasperation. "Come here today to study more of this universe?" he asks.
>
> Armin looks at where Alis was staring. "Ah that," he says. "No, I'm actually here on free time. I was actually thinking—if you have a moment, would you be interested in a friendly game of chess?"
>
> Alis's eyebrows perk. "Chess," he echoes.
>
> After mulling over the idea, he replies, "I suppose I wouldn't mind a round or two."

> _Check._
>
> Armin had made his next play.
>
> Looking at his move, Alis comments, "Armin, where do you find time for chess among your other interests? If you've made a breakthrough in time travel by now, surely you would have informed me."
>
> He responds with a move of his own, and Armin responds.
>
> _Check._
>
> "Are you looking for an answer, or are you looking to deduce the solution from my response?"
>
> _Check._
>
> "I'm seeking to deduce the solution from your... _curious_ playstyle."
>
> _Check._
>
> "Well, I suppose I _do_ have an ulterior motive."
>
> _Check._
>
> "Is that right? One which involves this unyielding series of—"

> Alis flinches, pinches the tip of his nose, then exhales with all the energy of a slowly-deflating balloon.
>
> He blinks and recovers. "Of course," he says, "you and your love of wordplay."
>
> "It shouldn't be a surprise, my dear cruciverbalist," Armin replies.
>
> "Is the reason we're playing on a touch-screen display so I can't flip the board over in vexation?"
>
> "...That part's just coincidence."

---

> A few moves later, Armin resigns from the game.
>
> "In all honesty," he says, "I haven't focused on chess since I started my undergraduate studies. You had the game won from the beginning."
>
> He folds the laptop closed and leans forward.
>
> "...In all seriousness," he adds, "I _would_ like to check with you. How has your life been post-Oneiros? What have you been working on?"
>
> Alis asks, "Are you looking for an answer, or are you looking to deduce a solution from my response?"

---

> "The former," he replies. "Really, I could deduce your experiences based on mine, but I'd rather hear things directly from you."
>
> He adds, "No games or mysteries." He gently shrugs. "Or tea, for that matter."
>
> Alis softly sighs.
>
> It had been over a year since anyone had asked how he was. That was well before Clementine, before Oneiros, and before the accident that led to his current position. He was still adjusting to the idea of people caring about him.
>
> He murmurs a quick "thank you", then starts explaining.
