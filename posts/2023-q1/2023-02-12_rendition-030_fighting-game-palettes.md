# Rendition 030 – Vic – Fighting Game Palettes (2023-02-12)

<img src="assets/2023-02-12_image-056.png">

## Overview

Following [my previous fighting game mockup for Vic](2023-02-11_rendition-029_fighting-game-mockup.md), I created a second set of color palettes using Vic as a base. This image acts as a complement to [my previous set of color palette references.](../2022-h2/2022-10-12_rendition-025_fighting-game-palettes.md)

These palettes take inspiration from characters with similar tropes as Vic, which I will explain below.

## Explanation

## Scrapped ideas

- Milo Thatch (_Atlantis: The Lost Empire_): This character has a similar build and role as Vic, but he is too endearing compared to Vic.
- Sweeny Todd (_Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_): This character has a similar appearance to Vic, but he is too macabre for Vic.
- The Medic (_Team Fortress 2_): This character has a similar role and personality to Vic, but he is too absurd compared to Vic.
