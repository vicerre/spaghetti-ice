# Rendition 064 â€“ Semirealism (2024-07-23)

<img src="assets/2024-07-23_image-188.png">

## Overview

The image in this post depicts an art study of Alis in a semirealistic style.

## Design notes

- Brushes used: Brush > Pastel > Pastel
- To make the image look sharper, I erased the thick parts of the outlines. The thick outlines made the drawing look blurry otherwise.

## WIPs
