# Illustration 065 – Vicerre Reference (2024-08-11 – 2024-08-14)

<img src="assets/2024-08-11_image-201.png">

## Overview

This image depicts a reference picture of Vic. I felt previous the reference picture (from 2023) was stale and unclear, so I created a new one.

## Design notes

- Ever since he mellowed out, Vic's eyes have become _[tareme](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaremeEyes)_ instead of _[tsurime](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TsurimeEyes)_.
