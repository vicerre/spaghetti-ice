# Illustration 062 – Romance (2024-07-12 – 2024-07-14)

<img src="assets/2024-07-12_image-186.png">

## Overview

This image acts as the seventh and final page out of my manga miniseries.

## Design notes

- Given its metaphorical nature, the layout of Vic's Headscape is symbolic of his headspace. The long reams of fabric in the inner sanctum symbolize the [Red String of Fate](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedStringOfFate) between him and Solana. Solana's scarf winding its way everywhere represents how she weaved herself into the very essence of Vic's life.
  - Inspirations for this visual metaphor include Arachne from _Hades II_.
  - Unintended similarities to this imagery include the visual design of _Journey_.
