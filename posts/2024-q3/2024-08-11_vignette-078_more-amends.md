# Vignette 078 – More Amends

<!--

His mind is a whirlwind, winding itself in circles upon circles, obsessed with focusing on anything else but. An obsession with undoing the damage, an obsession with getting everything right, obsession with curating his interactions...

-->

<!--

"We're thrust into the untamed wilds of what we call society, where we're expected to evolve and integrate into it. When this environment fails to support us, we find ourselves cast to the wayside."

He can only sigh before adding, "And people wonder how people like us become so misaligned."

-->

<!--

It's then a strange feeling takes him. It manifests first as confusion, and from there, it feels as though his heart were squeezed.

He recognizes the feeling as a deep, aching sorrow. Ever since he lost _him_, he had blocked out this feeling. It had been long enough since forgot he had the capacity to feel such things.

> Upon returning to the skybound grove, Vic finds Alis standing underneath the cherry tree. His stance is reversed, fingers pressed against his chin and gaze pointed towards the daisies.
>
> When Alis asked for an audience with him, Vic knew it wasn't for idle parlance. All the composure in the world couldn't mask the duress that surfaced in that instant. Now that they had isolated a time and place, Vic didn't need to inquire to know a maelstrom of thoughts and sentiments vaulted its way through Alis's mind.

---

> In one sense, Vic's presence here was superfluous; Alis would, unassisted, unravel the maelstrom with which he entered, and all Vic would observe are the fruits of his process.
>
> In another sense, though, it was his very presence that begat these fruits. The seclusion of the island, the vista of the grove, the company of a listener—they cultivated an environment in which Alis would best resolve his inner tumult.
>
> It's when Alis's gaze clears and he readjusts for the sun Vic offers him what he had left the lab for—a cup of spearmint tea, freshly from the kettle.
>
> After a short initial exchange, Alis accepts the cup.
>
> "I have a statement for you, if I may," he says.

---

> The herbal in Alis's cup quivers.
>
> "...I would like to issue a formal apology," he says, his locus aside.
>
> "I've realized my conduct towards you has been unbecoming. I've been abrasive in many of our interactions—and at my worst, openly belligerent."
>
> His gaze wanders along a circuitous path, starting with the cup in his hands, traveling through the arrangement of the grove, and ending with the countenance of his counterpart.
>
> "Meanwhile, you've offered me everything from the smallest of gestures to the most treasured of secrets. In addition, in moments of need, you've offered the most valuable use of our shared time."
>
> It was now as though he were sinking into his own skin, the hardness waning from his brow.
>
> "I'm deeply grateful for everything you've done, and for that, I seek to show additional discretion in interacting with you. Let the record indicate these statements as true."

---

> Alis's story was one with which Vic was all too familiar. He bore the weight of continued existence, one that both drowned him yet would propel him towards great and terrible ambitions, a howling storm upon the society that elected to carry on bereft.
>
> When Alis made his last statement, Vic identified something he had yet to observe in his years of knowing him—a gaiety in his breath. Just then, it was as though the weight he had borne had lifted, if only in passing.
>
> In Vic's story, the bleakest of howling winds yielded when confronted with the support of others. As it once held for Vic, so would it for Alis.
>
> Knowing this, Vic extends his response.
