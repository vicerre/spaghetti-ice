# Elucidation 057 â€“ Alis's Headscape, Revisited

Since the events of _Shaved Ice_, Alis has undergone significant character development: for instance, he has become more open to other people and more aware of his behaviors. As a consequence of these changes, the contents of his Headscape have changed as well.

To review, [Alis's Headscape was last represented as a cybernetic maze with a snowy sanctum at its center.](../2022-h2/2022-07-30_illustration-007_inner-space.md) The maze was bitterly cold, was laden with traps, and contained numerous locked doors with secrets behind them.

Since then, this environment has changed:

- Instead of a Hyperborean climate, the maze is less frigid than before. The atmosphere is just barely tolerable should the visitor lack the proper outerwear.
- While the hostile environment of the maze hasn't let up, it has become more manageable. Depending on the circumstances, Alis's mental self may be willing to meet with his visitor and guide him or her through the maze.
- In general, the ambience of the maze has improved. More circuitry within its halls has come abuzz, and more electronics have come to life. However, some of these electronics remain faulty.
