# Illustration 063 â€“ Hockey Stick (2024-06-27)

<img src="assets/2024-06-27_image-184.png">

## Overview

This image acts as a humorous follow-up to [Illustration 058](../2024-q2/2024-06-02_illustration-056_ice-scythe.md). In the previous image, I decided that Vic would transform his ice weapon from a bident to a scythe. Afterward, I realized hockey sticks were also associated with ice and could act like polearms. Due to this realization, I drew Vic holding a hockey stick.
