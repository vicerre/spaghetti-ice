# Icebreaker 136

> What are the factors behind your characters' design choices? Which of your characters has gone through the most changes? Is there anything you want to improve upon in future design iterations? ([2024-06-29](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1256813920857882707), Kiwi)

General notes:

- I rarely make explicit plans for a character's design. Instead, the elements that go into a character's design, more often than not, emerge as a byproduct of his or her characterization.
- As it evolves with the cycle of reincarnation, Solana's design is the most iterative and malleable of my characters.
- Among the design principles I want to improve upon include: clothing design, feet anatomy, hair shapes (less volumetric ones), material effects/textures, third-level detail

Individual character design principles:

| Principle         | Description                                                                          | Alis                                                                                                           | Solana                                                                                         | Vic                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Body language     | Each character uses a different set of body language.                                | Evokes a closed-off and defensive character.                                                                   | Evokes a friendly and light-footed character.                                                  | Evokes an open and balanced character.                                                                |
| Clothing coverage | To what extent each character is exposed reflects their emotional vulnerability.     | Dresses in a heavy longcoat and wears gloves. Is the most closed-off.                                          | Dresses the most lightly. Is the most open.                                                    | Alternates between layers depending on the season and wears fingerless gloves. Can be open or closed. |
| Clothing design   | Each character's outfit takes after their personality.                               | His clothing takes after classy, fantastical, and grandiose aesthetics.                                        | Her clothing takes after business casual and sporty aesthetics.                                | His clothing takes after academic aesthetics.                                                         |
| Clothing texture  | The fabrics that make up each character's outfit inform their level of friendliness. | His coat is winter-proof and has a fluffy collar. These elements represent his aloof exterior and softer side. | While not part of her clothes, she has a fluffy tail. This element represents her nice nature. | He wears a jacket lined with cotton. This element represents his friendly nature.                     |
| Color balance     | Each character has a color palette that reflects their personality.                  | Uses austere white and green-tinted shades from Vic (brown → olive, blue → pine green).                        | Uses vibrant red-orange.                                                                       | Uses classical browns, cool blues, and Solana-tinted reds.                                            |
| Counterbalance    | Each character includes design elements that offer a sense of movement.              | Wears a longcoat.                                                                                              | Has a tail.                                                                                    | Has a ponytail and wears a scarf.                                                                     |
| Shape language    | Shape language informs each character's personality.                                 | His design uses sharp, hostile triangles.                                                                      | Her design uses soft, safe circles.                                                            | His design uses balanced, angular rhombi.                                                             |
| Symmetry          | The degree to which designs are symmetrical informs each character's orderliness.    | Has symmetrical design elements.                                                                               | Has asymmetrical hair and accessories.                                                         | Has symmetrical design elements.                                                                      |

Additional character design principles:

- Body language: If you body-swapped each character, you should still be able to tell which character is which.
- Clothing pragmatics: Each character's outfit is underpinned by practical design; when performing an activity such as dining at a restaurant or reading a book, each character should look natural in their outfit rather than look like they're cosplaying.
- Hair design: Each character has perky hair. This design element stems from the principle of [Expressive Ears](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpressiveEars) as applied to animals. The only time animals fold their ears down is when they are scared or threatened. Likewise, characters with folded ears create the same impression.
- Orange diamonds: Alis and Vic share orange diamond shapes in their outfits. I don't know why they share this design element, but I hope to uncover its meaning in time.
- Uniqueness: You should be able to distinguish each character if given only one of the following: color palette, eye shape, hand design, silhouette
