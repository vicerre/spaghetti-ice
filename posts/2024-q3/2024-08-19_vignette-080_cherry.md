# Vignette 080 – Cherry

> A hug. A kiss.
>
> And then, as she bid him farewell for the night, Vic offered her a term of endearment. It was a single word, a common one, six letters in length.
>
> It was the first time he had given her any of these things, and he did it with such _nonchalance_.

---

> The Vic from a year ago would have thought these actions anathema. He feared growing close to her, growing attached to her, losing her and, in the wake, breaking his heart. At most, he would offer her a gentle touch of her hair or ask Alis to manipulate events in his stead—nothing like what he did just now.
>
> And then he was different. The little teas and ice creams he offered became tokens of hospitality instead of a ploy for her attention. The puzzles he shared came from a place of genuine connection rather than a need to impress.
>
> Somewhere along the line, he found what he was looking for.

---

> And yet, Vic was still unapologetically Vic. As he bid her good night, Solana could see that signature expression about him, that glimmer in his cyan eyes, the look of someone who simply _needed_ her to ponder over its hidden wordplay over the night.
>
> "As for my hint to you:" he told her, "I came up with the term in Firenze while dining on a Caprese."
>
> So it was later that evening, when Solana was scrubbing her teeth, she decided she would figure out three things: what a Caprese was, how cherries were involved, and what each had to do with her.

---

> By morning, Solana had found the answer, and it was as horrible as one would expect from a person of Vic's craft.
>
> ...And now that she knew the answer, she felt compelled to access Arklight's internal company records and file herself a last name.
