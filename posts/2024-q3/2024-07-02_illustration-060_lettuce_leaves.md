# Illustration 060 – Lettuce Leaves (2024-06-25 – 2024-07-01)

<img src="assets/2024-06-25_image-183.png">

## Overview

This image acts as page five out of my manga miniseries.

## Design notes

- Optimally, I should allocate more panels on each page for the narrative details that were abbreviated. In the case of this panel, these narrative elements would include:
  - Explicit acknowledgement Solana was no longer being under the influence of Oneiros.
  - Solana's reaction towards Vic's wordplay.
