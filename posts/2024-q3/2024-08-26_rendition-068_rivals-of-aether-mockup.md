# Rendition 068 – Rivals of Aether Mockup (2024-08-25 – 2024-08-26)

<img src="assets/2024-08-25_image-206.png">

## Overview

An updated _Rivals of Aether_-style sprite of Vic for use with palette swaps.

## Design notes

[Recently, Vic switched from a bident to a scythe as his weapon of choice.](../2024-q2/2024-06-02_illustration-056_ice-scythe.md) However, as his ice spark is damaged, he is unable to form a scythe made of ice. As an alternative, he can adapt the portals he creates into the shape of a scythe.

The goal of this sprite is to be used as a base for palette swaps. Thus, any design decisions made for the sprite take a lower priority. In particular, consider how effective and logical it would be to wield a portal in the shape of a scythe.

## Inspirations

- Bernadette (_Death Vigil_)
- Chronos (_Hades II_)
- Marluxia (_Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories_)
