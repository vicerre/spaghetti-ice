# Vignette 081 – Regenerative Abilities

> Vic was studying the hunk of carapace Pod gave him when he made a curious observation: whether it was in a hardened or softened state, the scars on its surface remained. In other words, injuries that affected Pod could not be healed by shifting them to a different state.
>
> Notably, this is different from how injuries affect shapeshifters in his dimension:
>
> Back in the Dream World, he had a human form and a kitsune form. Or well, "Armin" had one and "Vicerre" had the other. Injuries on one form stayed on that form, meaning that one form could be protected by switching to the other. (Also, this meant that "Armin" could take "Vicerre" as his hostage, but that's another story.)
>
> Furthermore, the polymorph abilities he granted Solana included regenerative abilities. In theory, the process of regeneration was simply an extension of polymorphism, so the same energy that morphed a hand into a set of claws could also be used to rebuild a broken bone in that hand.
>
> _In theory._

> You see, Vic never actually _tested_ any of those abilities.
>
> _Yes,_ he gets excited at the prospect of taking a blade to a creature—much less voluntarily, much less on his dearest friend. _No,_ he would not do so knowing there is a chance he would sincerely harm her! If something went horribly wrong, it would take him quite a few seasons to forgive himself. In this case, he can't reconcile the scientific and clinical part of him with the human part.
>
> He tells Solana all this. He's not actively looking for a _solution_, _per se_. He's not even trying to present this as a dilemma—Solana knew he would never hurt her. He just wants to let her know.
>
> It's then the Storyteller lets Vic in on a little fact: the best story she envisions is for something to go wrong and Solana and Vic withstand it together.
>
> Vic doesn't particularly want that.

> A moment later, the Storyteller receives word from an alternate suggestion, one made by Pod's overdeity. ("The one who gifted us a giant robot we sent to a storage dimension." "When was this again?" "He's the mosquito." "Oh, _him_.")
>
> This sort of invasive procedure, he told her, doesn't have to be enacted through the lens of a clinician. Consider this: People say you should never trust a chef who doesn't sample his own work, and likewise, you should never trust a bioengineer who doesn't do the same.
>
> "And in the worst case," the Storyteller adds, "I can always spin the threads of fate your way."
>
> But Vic isn't satisfied with this sort of solution, either. The image of him carving away at Solana's flesh with a kitchen knife comes to mind, and the thought comes a bit too barbaric for his tastes. (It's that blasted humanity, really.)
>
> ...The more he thinks about it, though, the more his gears in his head spin into motion.

> Vic returns to Solana with a proposal.
>
> Suppose he were to demonstrate to Solana how to make a stew out of a kraken. And suppose, when practicing, Solana were to nick her hands while chopping up the tentacles. Any injuries sustained this way would be incidental, yet they would still be worth analyzing. (He would be sure to extend Solana the proper precautions, of course, but he can never completely guarantee insulated conditions.)
>
> Regardless of how well or poorly the learning experience goes, they're doing something fun and getting something meaningful out of it together. Solana thinks the idea is, in her words, "not bad at all".
>
> So yes, they would get to carve Solana's flesh with a kitchen knife—on her behalf.
