# Vignette 077 – Out of Doors

> There was a doorway at one extreme of Armin's lab. It was of heavy design, consisting of unfinished carbon steel and spanning several meters.
>
> To Alis, however, the doorway simply wasn't. The area before it was ill-illuminated and served as storage space for the odd sundry rather than act as passage for persons. In his three years of knowing Armin, not one person perused that space, let alone attempt to pass through it. Instead, the fixture only served as a vestige of its history before the establishment of the lab.
>
> For this reason, Alis couldn't say he expected Armin to meet him there this morning.

> Armin's request wasn't _completely_ unexpected; Alis had earlier asked if he could discuss a _particular_ matter with him. In response, he took them to this part of the lab—and now, he was unsealing the doorway.
>
> While Armin was occupied physically, Alis was occupied mentally.
>
> By design, the lab was an isolate; the only method in and out was through one of the few tightly-regulated portals. Furthermore, other thoroughfares saw restrictions. The lab had no windows, operating purely on artificial lighting; internal temperatures steadied independently of local climate; and beyond the humming of machinery, there was no ambience beyond the walls. A visitor could more than believe the lab were buried deep underground, submerged underwater, or on the cusp of a dormant supervolcano.
>
> Armin so enjoyed his misdirection, however. A hermitage of any sort—whether physical or mental—only served as evidence to the contrary. Knowing this, Alis anticipates the lab to be located in the heart of downtown, sandwiched between an upscale deli and laundromat.
>
> It's then Armin turns the handle, the frame unseals, and the door opens to reveal—

> —an island.
>
> It wasn't the variety of island one would discover towards a ship's starboard, either. Instead, the island was suspended stories upon stories high, its edge air, and beyond, the sky-faring districts of New Quendon.
>
> To call the island "pleasant" would be to undersell it grossly. Lush grass formed a plush tapestry underfoot. Wildflowers hailed from its canopy, spilling their scented tinctures into the breeze. A short distance away bowed a sagely cherry tree, summertide rays weaving through its verdant foliage. A swift gust whisked with it any slights Alis might have conceived of the place.
>
> Alis can't exactly say it was _beyond_ him how Armin was able to keep such a secret from them all this time, yet he finds himself admiring Armin's commitment and precipitate all the same.
>
> "Alis?" Armin then says.
>
> He had made his way to a shady spot underneath the cherry tree.
>
> "Did you still want to talk?"
