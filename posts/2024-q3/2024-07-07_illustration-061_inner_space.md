# Illustration 061 – Inner Space (2024-07-02 – 2024-07-07)

<img src="assets/2024-07-02_image-185.png">

## Overview

This image acts as page six out of my manga miniseries.

## Design notes

- The ultimate goal of these manga pages is to create a self-contained story that provides an overview of the mechanics, characters, and narrative themes of my universe.
- Like how _Shaved Ice_ acted as my "major project" for the summer of 2022, this project seems to act as my "major project" for the summer of 2024.
- If I were better at drawing walk and run cycles, I would have drawn additional frames depicting Solana transitioning from a walk to a run.
