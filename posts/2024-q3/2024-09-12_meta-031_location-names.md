# Meta 031 â€“ Location Names

As you develop a world, you populate it with locations. As those locations become more involved, you might want to reference them by an all-encapsulating name rather than by description. Unfortunately, naming is hard, so finding the perfect location name takes planning.

When I conceive location names for my universe, I instill them with key attributes. These attributes ensure the name fits the tone and values of my universe. These attributes are as follows:

- **Location names must be fantastical.** My universe takes place in a setting with fantastical elements, so place names must be fantastical to match.
  - For instance, a polar region is named "Hyperborea", alluding to the mythological Hyperboreans of Greek mythology.
- **Location names must be intriguing.** Location names must be familiar yet not too familiar. A location name that is too ordinary is no longer fantastical, while a name that is wholly obtuse leaves the reader with the impression it cannot be understood.
  - For instance, a historical building is referred to as the Metropolitan, rather than the more casual name of the "Met".
- **Location names must have meaning.** There must be a clever reason behind the name given to a place.
  - For instance, the city of Firenze is a direct reference to the Italian word for Florence, which further plays on the English word "fire".
