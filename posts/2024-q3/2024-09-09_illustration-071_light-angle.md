# Illustration 071 â€“ Light Angle (2024-09-07)

<img src="assets/2024-09-07_image-215.png">

## Overview

I sometimes forget Alis is meant to resemble Vic, to the point where I become genuinely surprised when he does.

## Design notes

- Given some recent inspirations from an anime I watched, this image is designed as a mock storyboarding frame.
- I attempted a low-angle shot for this drawing, and I think it turned out well.
- Font used: [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans)
