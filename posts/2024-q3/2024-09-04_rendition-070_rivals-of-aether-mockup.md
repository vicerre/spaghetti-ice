# Rendition 070 – Rivals of Aether Mockup (2024-09-01 – 2024-09-02)

<img src="assets/2024-09-01_image-211.png">

## Overview

An updated _Rivals of Aether_-style sprite of Vic for use with palette swaps.

## Design notes

This sprite was more challenging to create, as I had never drawn Solana in a werefox-like form before.
