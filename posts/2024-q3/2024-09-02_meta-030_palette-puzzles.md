# Meta 030 â€“ Palette Puzzles

Palette swaps inspired by characters in popular culture are a recurring element on this blog. They started out as fun and simple ways to share characters similar to my own, but as I shared them, they evolved into small puzzles for other people to solve.

Given the context-heavy nature of using references in puzzles, I found the need to share an outline of how solvers should approach these puzzles.

Puzzle solving information:

- The name of each palette acts as both a clue towards character inspiration and as a checksum. Multiple characters can share the same color palette, but it is far less likely for multiple characters to match a given palette name too. Once you find the correct character, it should be immediately obvious what the palette name refers to.
- All characters referenced share multiple traits considered similar to the original character. Likewise, all characters referenced exclude certain traits considered too dissimilar to the original character.
- By design, each palette must be inspired by a character I know. If you are familiar with which media I am interested in, you will have a better idea of which works these characters are referencing.
- Palette names are designed in a way such that they can't be solved through Googling. Searching for the phrase online will only provide at most, a lead, rather than an answer. TV Tropes can be an effective search website since, by design, the website narrows its results to characters in popular culture.
- Each palette name is constructed such that the character inspires the name. Therefore, when identifying whether a character is the right match, consider which character leads to that specific name (instead of trying to fit names to possible matching characters).
