# Rendition 072 – Fighting Game Palettes (2024-09-19 – 2024-09-20)

<img src="assets/2024-09-20_image-217.png">

## Overview

A collection of palette swaps for Solana.

These palettes take inspiration from characters with similar tropes to Solana, which I will explain below.

## Explanation

Overall, the characters selected have the following attributes:

- They are female.
- They have fox traits.
- They are _kemonomimi_ (not anthropomorphic or simply fox-themed).
- They are an adult.
- They are mature.
- They are not villainous.
- They are not from a live-action work.
- They are not from a work where animal folk are the norm.

## Design notes

- I had eight palettes to create, so I did not prioritize the quality of the base art. Instead, I quickly drew Solana in an angular art style.
- These palettes are sorted chromatically by the color of the character's fireball.
- New to this set, each character is given a rating. This rating is on a scale from zero to five [sic], indicating how difficult the character is to identify online.
- Each palette name is divided into two words, an adjective and a noun. The adjective is revealed first and acts as a small hint. The noun is revealed second and acts as a large hint.
