# Icebreaker 137

> Which character is your cutest, both in-universe and out-of-universe? ([2024-07-01](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1257299041746681876), Kiwi)

By default, Solana is the cutest character among my core cast.

> "Teamwork makes the dream work," they say. In any context, which of your characters work well together? ([2024-07-02](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1257612126965469184), Kiwi)

I occasionally refer to the main trio of my universe as Team Arklight, so I expect each member to cooperate with one another. Among the members, Alis and Vic synergize the best, given how they share similar mentalities. Alis offers Vic additional supernatural resources, while Vic offers Alis additional insight. That said, these characters act as a "two heads are better than one" system, so they don't create any particularly explosive effects working in tandem.

> What would the polar opposite of your characters look like? In other words, which character and personality traits do you never incorporate into your characters? ([2024-07-03](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1258221942092202035))

Looking at the decisions I make when designing my characters, the polar opposite would be a stock fantasy dwarf. Dwarves are short, stout, burly, hairy, and fond of industry and strong drinks, none of which match my characters.
