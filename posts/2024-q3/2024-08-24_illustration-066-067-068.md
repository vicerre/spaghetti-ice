## Overview

These images depict a set of comics drawn in the style of newspaper comics featuring my core cast.

## Design notes

- Brushes used:
  - Background: Blend > Blend > Wet bleed blender
  - Lineart: Pen > Pencil > Pencil
- Fonts used: [Milk Mustache](https://blambot.com/products/milk-mustache)
- I referenced the comic strips _[Bizarro](https://comicskingdom.com/bizarro)_ and _[The Far Side](https://www.thefarside.com/)_ to determine which aspect ratio (5:6) to use for these comics.
