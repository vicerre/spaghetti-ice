# Elucidation 010 â€“ Nekorei

## Overview

The Nekorei is the id of the cast. Being a spirit, she is unharmed by the physical, so she often gets herself into situations other characters consider hazardous. What she lacks in awareness, however, she makes up for in curiosity and her odd perspective.

## Story notes

### Physiology

In order for the Nekorei to interact with the physical world, she needs to be tethered to a physical object. Normally, this takes the form of a special set of enchanted talismans. If needed, however, the Nekorei can instead tether herself to other objects.

The talismans are as vital to the Nekorei as organs are to a physical being. While the Nekorei is tethered to her talismans, they move like an extension of her. Destruction of a talisman is akin to permanent bodily harm on a physical being, which greatly limits her ability to interact with the world. Because of this, the Nekorei is cautious about untethering from her talismans, as that puts them at risk of being irretrievable later.

### Abilities

Given her unique nature, the Nekorei's abilities differ from those of physical beings:

- She can abuse her ability to become immaterial and slip through hard-to-reach areas. However, she is still limited by the corporality of her talismans.
- She is able to animate other objects she tethers to, albeit to a much more limited degree than when tethering to her talismans.
- If she is tethered to a living being, she can sense what that being senses.
- If she is tethered to a living being, she can "express" herself to that being.
- When tethered to inanimate objects, she lacks a sense of touch.
- For the convenience of plot, the Nekorei is able to talk.
