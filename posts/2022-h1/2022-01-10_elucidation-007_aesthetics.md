# Elucidation 007 â€“ Aesthetics

I recently learned of the concept of aesthetic culture from [a video by ColeyDoesThings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt3TT9vIIZg) and from Tumblr's tag system. I find that "aesthetics", when used in this context, fill a valuable niche in the English language in describing designs; being more succinct than describing the individual elements that compose the aesthetic.

Looking at Vicerre, I can identify elements of these aesthetics in his design, using names as described on the [Aesthetics Wiki](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Aesthetics_Wiki):

Physical appearance:

- Classic Academia
- hints of After Hours
- hints of Horror Academia

Office:

- Biopunk
- Dullcore
- Labcore
- Steelpunk
- Tinkercore

Surprisingly, neither element uses Science Academia as an aesthetic; it is too old-fashioned for him.
