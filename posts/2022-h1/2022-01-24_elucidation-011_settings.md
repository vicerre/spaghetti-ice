# Elucidation 011 – Settings

Most of the story takes place in New Quendon, a bustling, metropolitan city. This city provides an endless array of locations and events the characters can visit.

Recurring locations include:

- Vicerre's apartment: Located in the heart of the city, this modestly-sized space is where Vicerre lives and where he develops his devices. Most of the available surface area is dedicated to hardware, leaving his actual living space sparse in contrast.
- Solana's house: Located in a bedroom community outside the central business district, Solana's house acts as a casual hangout spot for humans and Pokémon alike. Solana and her guests often chat over tea in the sun room while their Pokémon freely roam in her spacious backyard. At other times, she and her guests will meet at her house before traveling to a local restaurant for lunch.
- Outskirts: Beyond the perimeter of the city is the wilderness, consisting of deciduous forest, rivers, cliffs, mountains, and other landmarks. A variety of wild Pokémon live beyond the city, making it a prime place for adventuring.

During the role play, this city was referred to as Castelia City from _Pokémon Black and White_.
