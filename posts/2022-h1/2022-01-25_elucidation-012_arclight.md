# Elucidation 012 – Arclight

## Overview

Having grown resentful of others, Armin developed a viral vector that suppressed his emotions in order to better focus on his analytical pursuits. Originally, it was intended for personal use. However, after falling under to the virus's influence, he concluded that humanity is irrational and that it would be better off if it followed a single will—namely, his own. Thus, Armin quickly adapted this pet project into an infectious virus. Among others, the virus eventually spread to one of Ishiro's companions, kickstarting his quest to save them—and Armin as well.

## Explanation

- The virus works by tampering with signal processing in the infected's frontal lobe and amygdala.
- The degree of mind control the virus imposes on the infected can be adjusted freely by the controller.
- While not absolute, this mind control requires intense willpower to defy.
- The virus spreads through physical contact.
- The effects of the virus can be reversed.

<!--
- The virus can transfer the controller's consciousness to a secondary host if the controller is in peril.
