# Elucidation 008 – Vicerre's Vocal Quality

Vicerre's vocal quality came about as a byproduct of his design. When writing his lines in role plays, I often imagined them being spoken in the voice of a similar, existing character to determine whether the line sounds in-character. This eventually amalgamated into the character's own voice. When writing lines for him, the following voices came to mind:

- When he is concerned or contemplative, Tom Wayland's performance as Arceus (_Pokémon_)
- When he is intrigued or irate, Derek Stephen Prince's performance as Vexen (_Kingdom Hearts_)
- When he is spiteful or stuffy, Neil Stewart's performance as Lawrence III (_Pokémon_)

- Lawrence III (_Pokémon the Movie 2000_, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmTzB0PV-uw)
- Luxord? (_Kingdom Hearts_)
- Valmont? (_Jackie Chan Adventures_)

Originally, my mental voice for Vicerre was in lower registers, which suited his role as an antagonist and his then-sci-fi-based design. However, as his characterization, personality, and design evolved, his vocal register lightened.

Nowadays, the voice I use for Vicerre has these qualities:

- Estuary English accent
- Light
- Nasal
- Soft

## Miscellaneous notes

Finding the source of a voice can be impossible if you forget where the voice is from. Unlike a character's visual design, voice is not something you can feed into a search engine or community forum and expect to get targeted results back. This was the case for one of the voices that I associated with Vicerre. I resorted to listing out the works of media I remember seeing in my childhood and trawling through them until, by chance, I stumbled upon the right voice.
