# Elucidation 006 â€“ Dream World Mechanics

One of Vicerre's defining inventions is a device that provides an environment for manipulating dreams, otherwise known as the Dream Machine. This, coupled with the effects of Dream Mist, allows for the controlled extraction dreams into reality.

Two models of the machine have been released to date:

- Version 0.1.3 ("The Prototype"): Originally adapted from a neural writing interface, this model takes the form of a headset and is attuned to the participant's natural sleep cycle. While originally functional without any other activation protocols, later versions would require the use of a secondary chemical agent to prevent abuse, or gamemaster permissions otherwise. Given that it is a prototype, the model is subject to unintended side effects.
- Version 1.0.2: This model extends the previous version to allow for long-term use. The user is placed in an amniotic tank that sustains their vital functions. A gamemaster is responsible for monitoring the welfare of the participant, which can be done either inside or outside the program.

## Story notes

- Vicerre dares people to abuse the Dream Machine for malicious reasons.

## Design notes

- The Dream World offers a mechanic for role play characters to What Ifs and alternate universes, which would otherwise disrupt the main continuity of the game. If one of these concepts is found to be fun for players, it can be brought back to the main universe (at the gamemaster's discretion). Otherwise, there is no lasting damage done.
