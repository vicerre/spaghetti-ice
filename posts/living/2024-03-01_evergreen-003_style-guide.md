# Evergreen 003 – Vicerre Design Style Guide

Last update: 2024-03-01

## Overview

Vic is hard to draw.

From the start of his existence, he was hard to draw. Before I could draw humans, I had a particular mental image in mind—one I could not capture for quite some time. Once I gained the skill to depict his likeness, I kept drawing him for fun—or, in other words, I never got tired of drawing the elements that made up his design.

I've been well-acquainted with Vic's design for years, so I have a very specific mental model of him. This acute familiarity is also what makes him hard to draw for those unfamiliar.

If you were to describe Vic's design to someone, you wouldn't think those elements would be hard to render. However, the _union_ of all these design elements gives Vic a uniquely-specific appearance. Through other artists' depictions, I've found it's very easy to overlook one of these core elements and, as a result, cause the resultant image to miss the mark.

If any of these factors deviate by even a sliver, the visual result is lost. In contrast, a character like Solana has a design that does not require finesse to render in other people's art styles.

Due to the precision required to draw his design, I thought I should offer a list of tips. Thus, this post acts as a resource for drawing Vic in other artists' art styles.

For each of these tips, I recommend overcompensating and adjusting from there.

- Vic uses sharp, angular shapes in his shape language. Try to draw him with as many concave lines and diamonds as you can.
- If I had to describe Vic's build in a single word, it would be "lanky". Try to draw him emaciated, then flesh him out from there.
- I find artists overcompensate Vic's age when drawing him. Vic is younger than he looks. His white hair is supernatural in origin, which he dyes to look his age. Try to draw him as though he were in his early 20s or even late teens.
- Vic's eyes are an icy cyan color, not simply blue. Use `#00FFFF` as a starting hue for his eyes.
- When posing Vic, draw him like a kinetic sculpture: he should look ostensibly balanced, yet though the slightest push would destabilize him.
- I have a soft spot for Burtonesque depictions of Vic. If you're not sure what direction to take, try drawing him in this style.

<!--

- Ponytail aside, Vic's hair is shaped like an oblate truncated bicone. Try to draw it as though it were a horseshoe crab.
- Vic is not conventionally attractive. Try drawing him halfway between the most sinister villain you can think of (he'll be flattered) and a mature Webtoons love interest (he'll be aghast).
