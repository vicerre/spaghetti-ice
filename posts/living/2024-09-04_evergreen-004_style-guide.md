# Evergreen 004 â€“ Alis Design Style Guide

Last update: 2025-07-17

## Overview

- Alis's shape language screams "sharp". Try to draw him with as many concave lines and diamonds as you can. Emphasize the scalene corners of his eyes and the hooked tips of his hair and longcoat. <!-- If Vic's design language is a labrador's, Alis's design language is a wolf's. -->
- Alis's design language screams "imposing". His outfit and body language give Alis a looming presence, the same way an eagle with its wings fanned might spell impending doom for its prey below. This is not to say Alis can't be drawn in casual situations, though. Depending on the context, Alis can tone down his imposing aspects, though you would never _quite_ feel you could let up around him.
- Alis is emotionally reserved. A small turn of the lips or a subtle widening of the eyes does more for him than an exaggerated facial expression. When drawing him reacting, less is more.
- When posing Alis, draw him in stable poses. He should look as though he should resist forces imposed upon him.
- When writing Alis, speak his lines while steepling your fingers. This forces you to assume the role of a manipulative mastermind the same way ALis makes himself out to be.
- I have a soft spot for depictions of Alis as a manipulative mastermind. If you're not sure what direction to take, try drawing him as this archetype.
