# Evergreen 005 – Character Aspects

Last update: 2025-02-14

## Overview

My characters and I form a convoluted relationship.

In one part, I treat these characters as fictive. These characters live in a world with fantasy creatures and supernatural abilities where they may interact with and clash with other fictional characters. When used this way, my characters are _creations_ whose personalities are derived from aspects of myself.

In another part, I use these characters as allegories. As these characters derive from aspects of myself, I often use the names of these characters as shorthand for elements in my mental state. It can be easier to explain myself in terms of known characters, _Inside Out_-style, than to explain the multitude of engrams that define this mind.

The remainder of this post addresses which characters of mine are allocated to (and thus, are associated with) which aspects.

## Underpinnings

Storyteller:

- cats
- nerdery
- OCs
- puzzles

Vic:

- inner child all grown up
- impulsive thoughts
- mildly nutty (all the easier to draw connections/puzzles)
- Science, [bleep] yeah!

## Individual traits

Personal note: Only add a trait if I can clearly state the following:

- `${character} has/is ${trait}.`
- `${character} has my ${trait} trait(s).`
