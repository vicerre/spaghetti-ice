# Evergreen 008 – Art Exchange Information

Last update: 2025-06-26

## Art you draw for me

Basic information:

- Reference information for each character can through other posts on this blog.
- In general, my preference for subjects drawn is as follows:
  1. Alis/Vic
  2. Solana
  3. Rot13(Nfgebybgy)
  4. other.
  - NOTE: Alis/Vic are more challenging to draw compared to my other designs. Take heed if you prefer to draw something fun.

Permissions:

- Gore, NSFW, and fetish artwork is permissible if and only if it is tasteful and canon-compliant.
- You may post your art on your social media profiles. If the subject you draw is a character exclusive to this account name, credit me under this account name. Do not refer to my other social media handles.
- After its completion, I will upload your art to this blog. By sharing your art with me, you give me permission to use your image for personal purposes.

Suggestions:

- Your art should be an _interpretation_ of my designs—don't be afraid to apply artistic license. The worst thing you can do as an artist is to regurgitate what I've already seen. As an example, consider how [professional TCG illustrators interpreted these fan-made drawings](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fan-Made_Cards).
- You will solicit a much stronger reaction out of me of you draw "fanfiction in visual form" than if you draw "fanart". I appreciate both, however.
- In general, I appreciate fanart more if I can tell you paid attention to who my characters are.

Gift art only:

- There are no strict restrictions on the level of effort or art style required from your side. I value seeing your personality shine through (though I appreciate art that is generally considered high-quality too).

Planned art only:

- You must provide an estimated time frame by which I should expect your art. This does not need to be a strict deadline. During this window, you must provide regular status updates.

Commissions only:

- You must be open to receiving light feedback on your art from me. Note that I consider myself forgiving as far as feedback goes, so you should not expect many suggestions, much less significant reworks.

<!--

- If, despite deadline negotiation and/or reminders, you fail to finalize your side of the art trade, I will call you out on social media.

## Art I draw for others

Basic information:

- I only draw art for known friends.
- Unless we agreed upon otherwise, I only draw characters.
- In general, my experience with drawing figures is as follows:
  1. humans
  2. creatures
  3. other organic designs
  4. abstract, geometric, and/or mechanical designs
  - I won't decline a request to draw most character designs, but a request to draw a design I have little experience with comes at your risk.

Permissions:

- After its completion, I will upload my art to social media.
- You may post my art on your social media profiles. If you do, credit me under this account name. Do not refer to my other social media handles.

Planned art only:

- During the art process, I will post regular progress pictures and accept feedback. If you fail to provide feedback, I will not make major adjustments later. I want to make art you enjoy, so don't hold back feedback if you have it! Please ensure the feedback provided is: 1. actionable, 2. not a list of overhauls, and 3. not a list of nitpicks.
