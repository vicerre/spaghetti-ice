# Vignette 067 – Role

> From under the blanket squirms a young woman, recently roused from the qualms of sleep.
>
> " ...Hey, Vic," she says.
>
> "Solana," Vic confirms.
>
> She wriggles over to him like an earthworm, butting her forehead against his chest.
>
> "You're intact," she says muffledly.
>
> "And still organic," he replies.
>
> "Organic?" Solana says. "...Oh, you saw my dream, didn't you?"

---

> Vic wishes he could say the experience came as a surprise. Given the erasure of the Dream World, shared dreams should have been harder to convolve. Given his recent superposition, though, he figured the other Armin's abilities were due to awaken eventually—dream-walking included.
>
> Not that he would bring this up—there were more pressing matters he had to attend to.
>
> "Well," Solana continues, "you know how the emotions you feel in dreams come from real life?" Solana asks. "I think my dream was trying to tell me something."
>
> "Go on?" Vic tells her.
>
> "Right," she replies. "Well..."

---

> "Between me and my past lives, I've played a lot of roles. I've played Ishiro's ally, a few kitsune of varying degrees of attitudes, the Gamemaster of the Dream World... and recently, I've played your lovely assistant and companion."
>
> Solana's final sentence was infused with a great fondness, as if she were nostalgic over something that hadn't ended yet.
>
> A hand slinks out of the blanket, connecting with the fluff on Vic's head.
>
> "Throughout these years, I've been there to accompany other people," she says. "I can't tell you how much it means to me to see them grow." Her voice echoed a sonorous, wistful sort of sigh.
>
> "In doing this, though, I think I've lost sight of my own needs."

---

> "I think that's why this incarnation resists having special powers," she says. "I didn't want to be admired for being special—I wanted to be loved for who I am."
>
> Solana's tone had been hushed all this time, and only now had it begun to roil.
>
> "And you know what hurts about that? I got you involved. I had to prove I was enough, and I thought your approval would be enough. But that's not right, is it? The only creatures who sustain themselves through others are parasites, and I can't play that role."
>
> Solana goes silent for a moment. Then, she adds, "I need to love myself first. Only then can I become who I want to be."
>
> Solana rolls back to her side of the bed, then makes a small huffing sound.
>
> "So, uh... thanks, Vic," she says. "I'm sorry if that was a load of thoughts I dropped on you at this hour. I guess I'm comfortable enough around you to share them now.
>
> "It would be my pleasure to hear them, Solana," he softly replies.
