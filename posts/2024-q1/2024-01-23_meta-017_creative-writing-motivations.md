# Meta 017 â€“ Creative Writing Motivations

The [Rinkworks Book-A-Minute archive](http://www.rinkworks.com/bookaminute/b/asimov.robot.shtml) has this to say about Isaac Asimov's _I, Robot_: It's a logic puzzle thinly disguised as a sci-fi story.

With this summary, the page posits an interesting question: what purposes do people find for creative writing?

Creative writing can come from a range of motivations; it can be used to evoke feelings in the reader, raise a philosophical dilemma, offer life advice, promote unheard voices, and so on. It's one reason why, when someone seeks to be an aspiring writer, it helps to understand why it is they seek to write.

Within the context of my blog, I think it's worth addressing my own motivations for writing.

When this blog started, my primary motivation was to document my thoughts. I had constructed an elaborate fictional world in my mind, and by writing it down, I could reference my ideas without relying on memory.

Over time, however, this motivation changed. Instead of simply logging what once was, I felt inspired to build on top of what I made. The ideas I had were fine in of themselves, but they had so much more unexplored potential. The more I wrote on my ideas, the more they threatened to lure me into a deep abyss of inspiration.

Ultimately, I write because it is fun. It is a hobby in which I can partake in multiple pleasures, including those of definition, creation, and resolution.

Yet, I know this fun must end eventually. The uncharted regions of my universe are becoming fewer and fewer. Once they exhaust, I will lose my will to write, and I'll move onto other hobbies.

I can't consider such a fate a true end to my universe, however. _Shaved Ice_, after all, was formed out of a desire to share the events of the long-lost role play that gave birth to my universe. Over time, I might form fond memories of the stories I told on this blog, and eventually, I might revisit them. If not, well, I can't say I hadn't done my part in documenting what my universe meant to me.

Regardless of what fate ultimately awaits, I must express the following sentiment: as of the time of writing, it was a pleasure to write this blog.
