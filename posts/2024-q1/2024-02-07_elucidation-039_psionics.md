# Elucidation 039 â€“ Psionics

Like all supernatural abilities in my universe, Alis's psionic abilities adhere to a set of principles. These principles are tailored in a way that both ensures internal consistency and fulfills the needs of the narrative. As of writing, I've only described the effects of these abilities, but I've yet to explain how they operate in detail.

This post acts as a reference for these abilities.

- Alis can manipulate chemicals within the nervous systems of organisms. Chief among those is acetylcholine, a chemical used for motor control, brain signal modulation, and the operation of various parasympathetic systems, among other functions.
- By extension, Alis can perform the following:
  - He can scan an organism's mind.
  - He can send signals to/block signals from an organism's mind.
  - He can control an organism's actions.
- To the benefit of his peers, the implications of Alis's abilities go far beyond what he permits himself to perform.
- By extension, this ability is ineffective against systems that do not follow traditional neurology. For instance, [Alis could not read the Storyteller's avatar](../2023-q4/2023-10-14_vignette-060_the-visitor.md) as it lacked a normal nervous system.
- Alis's psionic abilities have limited range. Generally speaking, the more intense the effect, the smaller its range. If he were to send a message to another organism, he could do so across several kilometers. If he were to only control an organism's actions, however, he could only do so from a distance of under half a kilometer.
- Alis's psionic abilities require concentration to use persistently. For instance, if he were to control a person and were interrupted, he would lose control.
