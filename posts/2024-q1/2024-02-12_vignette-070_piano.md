# Vignette 070 – Piano

> All Alis asked for were suggestions.
>
> He admitted to Armin earlier he had a less than stellar day, and he asked for methods of assuaging his current state of mind. In response, Armin proposed an idea to him.
>
> ...Following the proposal, both of them were seated in front of a concert hall piano. It wasn't in front of a stage, empty or otherwise—that would be far too extensive a locale—but rather in one of the private practice rooms within.
>
> Somehow, he wasn't surprised Armin had the access.

---

> Armin's hands grace the piano's surface, the fingers sunk into the ivory keys. The piano rings out, producing a set of triads.
>
> "Like most people," he said, "I can't simply project emotions onto others. Instead, to accomplish this task, I need to convert those emotions into a medium our senses can perceive."
>
> Considering the choice of locale, he was referring to music.

> "It's a challenge working within standard human limitations," Armin tells him. "There are some things you wish you could transmit directly, of course. It's a puzzle to find the right expression, and it means the world when the message resonates correctly."
>
> Then, his fingers spring out like a cloven hooves of a gazelle. They prance on the keys, producing an expressive yet melancholic tone.
>
> The tones then change. If each note were a written word, Armin had now strung together sentences—except, instead of stating what bare words could define, he was constructing a sentiment that could not otherwise be captured.
>
> What strikes Alis as remarkable is quality of the sound. Judging by the performance alone, the music is polished in a way that defies the quality of the instrument.
>
> How many times had Armin worked these keys until the right sound came out, Alis wonders?

---

> "Now..."
>
> Armin rests his fingers, then looks at Alis.
>
> "What I'd offer in this situation is for you to work my hands, but..." he tells him, "given the look in your eyes, I have the impression you're looking for something else."
>
> "That's accurate," he replies; as soon as they stepped into the room, Alis's mind had stewed away at one particular thought.
>
> "Perhaps we could consider the opposite method," he says. "Instead of letting my motives work your hands, perhaps you could be the one to guide mine."
>
> He glances aside. "From the perspective of Oneiros, you and I are genetically identical, so you should have full access to it."
>
> Armin was now fretting to face him.

> "If you are to suggest I should manipulate your actions," he says, "there's a _reason_ I've never done that."
>
> Armin's response was valid; it would have been the correct course of action in any other case. To propose giving up one's volition to someone who had lost everything he cared about would have been nothing short of hazardous—and if Armin made this sort of proposition even a few months ago, Alis would have considered paralyzing him.
>
> But today, he was sitting next to his counterpart, his mind and ears open to the melodies he had composed, a form of expression that could, perhaps, extend beyond his immediate circle. He was the one who made the proposal, and with it, a genuine interest in learning from him.
>
> Alis shrugs and perks his mouth up.
>
> "Well," he replies, "you have a reason now."
