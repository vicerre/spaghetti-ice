# Illustration 044 â€“ Pixel Icon (2024-02-12)

<img src="assets/2024-02-12_image-132.png">

## Overview

The Discord server I share my writing and art to may be switching to a forums format. To prepare for that change, I wanted to come up with splash art of my universe. This art would act as the cover image of the forum thread I would create.

In a flash of panicked brilliance, I conjured the icon which I have presented here.

## Design notes

- Overall, the icon is designed to evoke the themes of my universe. It is minimalistic and icy, yet not without foregoing additional literal and metaphorical color.
- The shapes that compose the icon include the following layers of meaning:
  - They form the letters "SI", the initials of _Spaghetti Ice_.
  - They resemble the snowy swooshes Vic has been seen to conjure ([1](../2023-q1/assets/2023-02-04_image-055.png), [2](../2023-q3/assets/2023-07-24_image-080.png)).
  - They imply a shape twisted into a helix, matching that of Vic's scarf.
