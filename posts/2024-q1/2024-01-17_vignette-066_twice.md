# Vignette 066 – Twice

> As he stirs awake, Vic notices his physical state was... well, not _strained_, but certainly less refreshed than it could have been. He didn't fall asleep as tense as he was currently, and certainly not with a numbing sensation at the spot where Alis once skewered him. Considering his last memory, he figures the imagery from the dream triggered an automatic response.
>
> With one hand clutched, his fingers discover a clump of shards protruding from the spot on his head. The clump couldn't have been larger than his palm, and each shard erupted in separate directions away from the dermis. Each surface was hard and cold, and bits of it sheared away upon touch.
>
> Upon recognizing the material, Vic's thoughts turn from idle observation to intrigue.
>
> With a terse twitch of the hand, the shards emerging from his head vaporize, relieving him of the numbing sensation and leaving him with the usual sensation of keratin.
>
> With a second twitch, flecks of snow condense on his finger.
>
> Vic wasn't sure whether to be relieved or disappointed about the discovery.

> By now, Vic hadn't been able to manifest ice for multiple months. Yes, he tried to summon the ability now and again, but it was a bit like flapping your arms in hopes you'd rise into the air; he never honestly expected it to work, and it was, at best, an idle fancy.

> This time was different, however; circumstances had it such that your call was answered, and yet, considering the nature of said circumstances, you were left wondering whether you wanted an answer at all.
>
> On one hand, the promise was tantalizing. The less he diverged from the common human experience, the more normal he could be. The knowledge he could _belong_ eventually was one he did not take for granted.
>
> On the other hand, you can't spell "Vicerre" without "ice". Between him and the other Vicerre he knew, it seemed like these abilities simply had to be—and to his admission, he can't say he didn't enjoy being his own beast.
>
> For now, he would have to settle with the knowledge that he was him.
>
> ...He thinks, anyway.
