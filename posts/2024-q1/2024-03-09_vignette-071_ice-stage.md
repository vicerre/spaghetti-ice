# Vignette 071 â€“ Ice Stage

> [The day he recounted the Storyteller's timeline,](2024-01-27_vignette-069_a-story.md) Vic wanted to fashion a much grander performance for Solana. Instead of conjuring shapes made of snow in the palm of his hand, he originally planned to freeze over the park's lake to use as a stage.
>
> Unfortunately, there was one part of his plan he overlooked; following reconstruction, he had forgotten his ice abilities simply weren't functioning correctly. Once he took a single step onto the water, he sank straight in.
>
> Despite the outcome, the demonstration seemed to have served its purpose: Solana seemed entertained. When Vic strode in, the biggest, most genuine grin grew on her face. Then, when he returned to dry land, she blow-dried his soaked shoes... then signaled pointedly to the "no swimming" sign several meters over.
