# Elucidation 063 â€“ Polymorph Mechanics

Recently, Solana has been given the ability to polymorph. So far, she and Vic have determined this ability respects the following mechanics:

Function:

- Solana needs to concentrate to morph her body. Any disruption will leave her in a half-morphed state. Retaining the final shape, however, does not require concentration.
- Solana retains full sentience between forms.
- When morphing, Solana leaves her clothes behind.
- Mass is not conserved between forms. Extra mass is spliced in and out as needed.
- It takes roughly two seconds for Solana to morph a human-sized unit of mass.

Design:

- Solana can morph into any creature she has reincarnated from. In practice, she can morph into combinations of human and kitsune forms. <!-- owl-gryphon -->
- Solana can only morph into female versions of forms.
- When morphed into an alternate form, Solana tends to retain her red-orange mane and tail(s) for easy identification.
- When morphed into a bestial form, the fur on Solana's body becomes copper-like in color (muted orange or light brown).

Forms:

- Solana can assume forms that are otherwise impractical for a standard living being, such as a shape that is grossly bony or spindly.
- The size of her forms does not need to match the size of the original forms. She can adjust the scale to be any value practical under standard physics. In practice, this means that kaiju and baby sizes are outside her range.
- Solana uses "zombie rules" in determining what is a valid form. As long as she has an intact head, it is valid. A "head" is considered the body part her brain and most sensory organs are held.
- Solana can create extra heads. However, only one of them will be sentient.
- There is no limit to the number of times Solana can form a body part. For instance, she could assume a centipede-like shape containing dozens of limbs. There is, however, a limit to the number of body parts Solana can manipulate at once. At most, Solana can manipulate eight limbs on a given form. Arms, legs, wings, and tails are considered limbs.
