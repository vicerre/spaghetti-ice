# Icebreaker 108

> What is your character's ideal example of a date? For non-romantic characters, what is your character's ideal example of a hangout? ([2024-02-14](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1207297235650347028))

- Alis: Isn't completely against the idea of patronizing a quality art museum, whether local or abroad. Don't expect him to make anything more of the visit, however.
- Solana: Enjoys activities that inspire wonder and awe. Examples of such activities include:
  - A visit to a remote observatory to see the constellations free of light pollution.
  - A local meet-and-greet with creatures exotic to New Quendon.
- Vic: Either `yyyy-mm-dd` or Solana.

> Someone flirts with your character. What happens next? [(2024-02-14](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1207381186876547083))

Assuming the person flirting isn't someone they know already:

- Alis: Graciously informs the person he has no plans to reciprocate and that he or she should look elsewhere. If the person is persistent, uses his abilities to route him or her away by force.
- Solana: Appreciates the gesture, but she's taken! She's more than happy to just hang out with them, though.
- Vic: Registers the person is flirting with him, but doesn't really treat them any differently than how he normally would.

# Icebreaker 110

> Which species of flower best symbolizes your character? ([2024-02-16](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1208071549144399954), [amemcake](https://www.tumblr.com/amemcake))

- Alis: Edelweiss. This species of flower is only found on alpine mountaintops and blooms rarely matching Alis's hardy, fickle nature.
- Solana: Sundew. This plant sounds sunny (and that it is), but it is also known for being carnivorous. Likewise, Solana is sincerely sunny but also has a freaky side to her.
- Vic: _Lycoris radiata_, AKA the red spider lily. It's red! And named after spiders. And associated with death. What's not to like?

# Icebreaker 111

> What is the most cringe and/or fail thing your character has done (or will do)? ([2024-02-18](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1208805032758091797))

- Alis: Among the items he will disclose, he supports Solana's and Vic's developing relationship.
- Solana: Lack of manners at the dining table aside, one of her past lives once ate the entire apple, core and all.
- Vic: Any pretense of him being a well-put-together person falls apart immediately upon interacting with people outside the Storyteller's domain.
