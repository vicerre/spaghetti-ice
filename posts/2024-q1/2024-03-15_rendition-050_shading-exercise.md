# Rendition 050 – Shading Exercise (2024-03-13)

<img src="assets/2024-03-13_image-137.png">

## Overview

Over the past months, I've been playing with Stable Diffusion. It is a tool that can generate aesthetically- and compositionally-pleasing images, so I find value in it in studying aesthetics and composition.

Following these studies, I decided to produce a visual checkpoint of my art capabilities. To do so, I drew a vanilla Vic. Usually, I experiment with an art fundamental when I draw, but I refrained from doing so this time. Instead, I focused on rendering.

I could not keep myself from trying something new, however. Since I last held my stylus, I had acquired a new brush to use in Clip Studio Paint. When I shaded in my piece, I chose to try it out. As a result, the output of this drawing looks softer and more natural, which I think looks pretty.
