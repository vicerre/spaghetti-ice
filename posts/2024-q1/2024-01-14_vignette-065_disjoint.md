# Vignette 065 – Disjoint

> It had been some time since Vic saw this scenery last.
>
> Before him was an environment one could hardly refer to as "land". It consisted predominantly of a reflective, mist-like substance—some amounts dense enough to support his weight, while others defied gravity, billowing high into the atmosphere, forming lofty canopies that fought indignantly towards the heavens. The air had to it a diffuse concentration of hues, as if a gardener decided to aerate the space with water-based paints.
>
> He would have considered the air crisp, except there was the scent of something burning.
>
> It doesn't take much time for Vic to realize the source of the scent; the scarf he wore—the one gifted by Solana—had caught fire.

---

> He quickly unwinds the scarf, then invokes his ice abilities to snuff the flame out. To his inconvenience, those abilities fail to come to him.
>
> He was about to try his portals next when he realizes something strange.
>
> The smoke produced by the fire hadn't dissipated. Rather, it seemed concentrate several meters above him. More alarming, it seemed to be taking on increasingly coherent shapes.
>
> The shape it took could only be described as an amalgamation. Multiple visages sprouted from the center mass, in which he recognized a man's, woman's, and one belonging to something not quite human. Their thunderstorm eyes flashed and spasmed, their gazes seemingly bereft of Vic's presence. Between those heads were a myriad of bestial shapes, ones with snarling jaws and extended claws, each shape rolling from one form to the next.
>
> Vic's body suddenly becomes tight, as though something were crushing it from all sides.
>
> Then, the ground beneath him begins to give way. He stumbles for the next footstep, only to sink deeper into the morass. He jerks his leg up, only for something to ensnare his feet, keeping them entrenched. It's only when he diverts his attention downward does he notice a lack of iridescent hues and instead, the shades beneath him were a pitch, fathomless black.
>
> Something else then catches his attention.

---

> Far beyond his position, at a point touching the horizon, he makes out a figure. The licks of scarlet locks and red woolen jacket make it evident this was Solana. He wastes no time throwing out a portal, throwing out a hand, and—
>
> Then his hand breaks off.
>
> It hurtles towards Solana, knocks into her from behind, and lingers in the air. The stump where his hand used to be doesn't hurt, but he can't move or feel beyond the missing limb.
>
> He tries to throw his voice instead, and when he does, needles form in his throat. When he tries again, the needles grow sharper. When he tries a third time, the needles distend, and his head snaps away.
>
> It's then he could see his body half-sunken and fractured into prismatic shards. From the corner of his vision, he could see Solana's silhouette pick up his hand and head, then reach for his other shards...
>
> And then the darkness roars back, tearing him, ripping away the shards Solana had collected, drowning out his vision, until the only light he could see became mottled flecks, the light of stars straining deep into an ever-growing abyss.

---

> And then, everything was warm, quiet, and dark.
>
> Before him was Solana again. Only this time, she was in her nightwear. Her face peeked out of her blanket, barely visible against the ambient darkness. Vic could feel each puff of breath she let out.
>
> She was fast asleep, looking so peaceful curled up next to him, continuing to dream away the night.
>
> It was just Solana.
