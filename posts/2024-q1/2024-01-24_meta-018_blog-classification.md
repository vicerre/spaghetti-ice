# Meta 018 — Blog Classification

Since I created it, I've struggled to classify this blog.

On one level, this blog is a dream journal. All a fictional universe _is_ is a daydream maintained for years and years. It starts off as idle whimsy, but you end up creating characters, and then you get too attached to them to simply let them go. Eventually, you start chronicling their journeys in hopes that, once their journeys have been accounted for, they may be freed from your mind.

Calling this blog a journal, however, diminishes the other qualities that compose it. Yes, my writings form a log of ideas, but it is so much more. I can't simply throw a smattering of ideas; instead, I form connections between ideas until they form a narrative structure. I create a composition out of individual ideas.

In some parlance, this style of composition would qualify the blog as a work of literature. After all, one form literature takes is that of a good story, and a good story requires the skillful composition of individual ideas.

I can't say I'm comfortable labeling this blog as "literature", either. The term presupposes dissemination and analysis, and given the personal nature of this blog, I find these qualities incongruent with the blog's purpose.

It's possible there is another category this blog fits into, one with a much neater classification than either "journal" or "literature". Perhaps all this reasoning over what kind of blog this is simply highlights the flaws of strictly-defined classifications. Perhaps, simply, I failed in my obligation to share these thoughts in an orderly manner. In that case, the title _Spaghetti Ice_ is fitting.

Perhaps one of my friends is the one who put it best—this blog can only be called a writer's original.
