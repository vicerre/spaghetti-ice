# Vignette 069 – A Story

> "Would you like to hear a story, Solana?"
>
> Solana and Vic were on a walk through New Quendon's central park when Vic raised the question.
>
> "What kind of story is it?" she replies.
>
> By this time, Solana looked more-or-less normal. She was bundled in a puffy red coat, leggings, and boots. She had a pair of earmuffs around her head, which would have looked natural if they hadn't sprouted out of her.
>
> "It's a tale from the Storyteller," Vic says, "one that weaves the fates of her darling characters into a grand design."
>
> "...It's not the story of how we got to this point, is it?"
>
> "Well, I wouldn't need to tell you _that_ one, now, would I?"

---

> "Instead—"
>
> Vic sets the scene; he extends the palm of his hand towards her, and snow begins to form on its surface. The snow coalesces into a small human figure, one that appeared to be making a waving motion towards Solana.
>
> "...That's me," she says, the awe in her breath visible.
>
> "Roughly speaking," he replies. "It's... well, let's call it another version of you."
>
> "Like an alternate universe counterpart?"
>
> "_Like_ an alternate universe counterpart."

---

> "This version of Solana follows the same journey as you," he says. "She was supportive and congenial, and when she realized what she was looking for, she made herself emotionally vulnerable to a certain Armin Vicerre. From there, they performed an experiment that granted her the ability to morph in shape.
>
> "Do you know what the Storyteller decided then?"
>
> The snow in Vic's palm becomes an amorphous blob, before reconfiguring into... well, she supposes that's her. The only tell that stayed the same was the shape of her curls, while the growth spurt, elaborate outfit, imposing stance, and fire-like veil behind her instead suggested someone befitting what could be a JRPG final boss.
>
> "Since she was no longer _normal_," he explains, "Arclight should kick in."
>
> "Oh," she says.

---

> "She then resoundingly decided the only way to be her own person was to violently 'sever the connections' of those she cared about."
>
> A short scene then plays out on the snow.
>
> The snowy Solana figure was in Vic's lab, throwing streams of fire onto the lab's facilities and collection of samples. When Snow-Vic discovers her actions, he tries to speak with her, only for her to conjure a row of fireballs for the interloper. Vic forms a wall around Solana, but she blinks outside it. It's only when he's able to throw a portal over her is he able to get a moment of peace.
>
> "Now at this point," he says, "I'm was supposed to consider this incident a fun change of pace. Between the fireballs and teleportation, I'd have to be resourceful in finding a way to make you come to your senses.
>
> "It's supposed to be all very ironic, given how I'm confronting the very catalyst that started my own journey."

---

> Another figure walks through the interdimensional portal, looking at the shattered glass and (what Solana imagines) are scorch marks. Snow-Vic portals within speaking distance, only for the other figure to promptly leave the way he came.
>
> "We'll come back to Alis," Vic explains. "But for now, it was just me."
>
> Snow-Vic scrambles to the supercomputer, only he couldn't seem to make it work the way he wanted. He then makes a call.
>
> "It was a good thing the sequence for Arclight's counteragent was leaked, wasn't it?" he tells her. "After you rendered the lab inoperable, I reached out to Evon for help."
>
> That was the person who asked about the data breach that one time. Leave it to Vic in this sort of scenario to find the right people in an emergency.
>
> "He was surprised by the call, but he was willing to synthesize the counteragent, so long as we could stall you out for an estimated, oh, three hours, forty-nine minutes."

---

> "...Hey, Vic?" Solana interjects.
>
> Vic looks up, then notices the expression on Solana's face.
>
> "Ah, you're concerned about the version of you in this story, I take it?" he says. "Whether you're destined to share in her fate and shatter the hearts of the people around you?"
>
> Solana slowly nods.
>
> Vic smiles pensively. "Perhaps I'm spoiling things by telling you this early, but... well, that's exactly the reason why this is simply a story."

---

> The narrative in his hand vanishes, and his fingers curl up.
>
> "There would have led to a great, bombastic sequence where everyone we encountered along our journey arrived to help out. Alis would've returned with Monaghan and Neko atop two gryphons, and Zada and Nia would have arrived with the counteragent. It's possible we'd also encounter people outside the Storyteller's domain again. All this would have led to a final showdown of sorts between us.
>
> "...And in the end? The Storyteller couldn't do it. She laid out the board and pieces, but she couldn't simply rip away everything we worked towards for the sake of a winning game. The plan she crafted since the beginning? Cancelled. Scrapped. Erased. That moment on our timeline was gone before we could even reach it.
>
> "In the end, the Storyteller had devised a story, but it couldn't have worked out. It could have made a good and fun story, but it wasn't _our_ story."
>
> Vic uncurls his fingers, revealing a small clamshell box in his palm.
>
> Solana takes in a long breath.
>
> "You're saying you have another story in mind."

---

> Solana can't help but bunch up her shoulders. If it were anyone else, Solana would have wondered whether this was some sort of engagement proposal. Knowing Vic, though, a proposal had to be the last thing on his mind.
>
> Right?
>
> She takes the box out of Vic's palm. The box was the sort you would see in the display window of a gift shop, its exterior crafted from wood and stained.
>
> Solana looks expectantly at Vic.
>
> She asks herself whether Vic told her this yarn of a story for the sake of a bad pun she now held in her hands. Given the seriousness with which he carried himself, though, she doesn't think this is a gag.
>
> "Go on," he tells her. "Open it."
>
> She does.
>
> ...
>
> She looks inside.
