# Rendition 048 – Rebelle 2 (2024-02-28 – 2024-02-29)

## Overview

Recently, I caught wind of a Stable Diffusion model called [Pony Diffusion XL](https://civitai.com/models/257749) (NSFW warning). This model was posted to the Stable Diffusion Reddit community and, from reading comments, was widely regarded as the best model for drawing stylized characters on Stable Diffusion XL.

After trying out this model, I was inspired to draw Vic in Rebelle.

## Design notes

I chose Rebelle for its brush engine. Between the art programs I've tried, Rebelle is unparalleled in physics fidelity. This allows me to create natural-looking art without applying a significant number of post-processing steps. In doing so, however, I also noticed more flaws in the program, ones that prevent it from being my preferred choice:

- There is a noticeable delay between tapping on a keyboard shortcut to switch a tool and being able to use the tool. This is noticeable when I want to erase an area but instead draw over it, or when I try zooming and instead leave a mark on the canvas. To resolve this issue, I need to undo my last action or, otherwise, slow down every time I switch tools. Either way, it reduces productivity.
- There is no way to toggle between subtools with a keyboard shortcut. For example, to make a selection, I would want to select the Select tool. From here, I might want to switch between the Freehand and Magic Wand subtools depending on which part I want to select. To switch between these two subtools in Rebelle, I need to tap on the appropriate icon. In a program like Adobe Photoshop, I could use a second keyboard shortcut instead.
- The Transform tool offers less productivity than those in other art software:
  - It cannot be used on multiple layers at once.
  - Transform selections do not appear in the Preview pane until after the transformation is complete.
  - Transformations cannot be "nudged" by using the arrow keys, making it harder to make small, precise changes.

Despite these flaws, I find Rebelle a promising program, and I look forward to seeing it improve in future iterations.
