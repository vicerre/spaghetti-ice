# Meta 020 â€“ Naming Conventions

[I said it in 2021,](../2021/2021-07-02_meta-002_blog-name.md) and I'll say it again: naming things is hard.

To grant a concept a name is to breathe life into it, and to assign it the wrong name is to doom it to a confusing and painful death. For this reason, I find it difficult to assign strict identities to my works; the English language lacks the words needed to express the essence of each concept.

Instead, the names I grant my works act closer to those of roles. This is closer in structure to how a person might have a legal name but is best known by their job position or personal achievements. In that sense, none of the names I give my work can be considered a "true name".

I would still like to categorize my works and the various names they may receive, however. Therefore, this post acts as a reference for these names.

As of writing, the names by which I call my works are as follows:

| Installation | Medium      | Theme Name    | Aesthetic Name | Encoded Name                               | Decoded Name |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1            | Role Play   | Spaghetti Ice | Spaghettieis   | _n/a_                                      | _n/a_        |
| 2            | Web Fiction | Shaved Ice    | Stracciatella  | Awkwardly Step Around Him for a Fresh Herb | Spearmint    |
| 3            | Web Serial  | Cherry Ice    | Maraschino     | It's Cardinal He's in the Common Era       | Carmine      |
