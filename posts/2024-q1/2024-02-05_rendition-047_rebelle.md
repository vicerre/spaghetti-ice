# Rendition 047 – Rebelle (2024-02-04)

<img src="assets/2024-02-04_image-129.png">

## Overview

The program [Rebelle](https://www.escapemotions.com/products/rebelle/about) has caught my eye recently.

As of writing, the field of 2D graphics software is dominated by several well-established programs. Programs like Adobe Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, and Procreate are used by many artists, including many industry professionals. The programs in this space have competed for years to be the most advanced and streamlined experiences for consumer artists. Between the common industry picks, it's not easy for a new program to break into the space.

Rebelle, however, is a promising contender.

A commonality between each of the art programs listed earlier is in their graphics technology framework. Early drawing software was limited to what was, effectively, applying a single stamp on a pixel canvas, interpolated to create the illusion of a brush stroke. As technology improved and processing power increased, the methods became more sophisticated, and so did the illusion. Ultimately, however, graphics software continued to rely on the same, decades-old framework.

Rebelle takes a different approach to graphics.IInstead of building on a principles that are inherently digital at heart, Rebelle applies our understanding of graphic technology today to how art media _should_ behave. With this framework comes an approach to 2D graphics that is unparalleled in realism.

Rebelle is one of those programs that crept up on me.

Originally, I noticed it in a single place: a presentation by Pav Grochola, an FX Supervisor for Sony Picture Imageworks. He shared many parts of the development cycle behind _Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse_, and [I noted Rebelle as the program used to simulate realistic watercolor effects.](https://www.escapemotions.com/blog/from-brush-to-big-screen-role-of-rebelle-in-crafting-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse)

Later, however, I came across the program on YouTube. The art YouTuber Sycra [used this program as the backing video to one of his videos.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5zvngcGr0s)

As I had seen two authoritative sources use it, I was convinced to try the program out. As my first experiment with the program, I drew Vic, my standard test subject.

## Design notes

As someone coming from other graphics software, I found Rebelle's UI intuitive. Switching from Adobe Photoshop → Clip Studio Paint required several days of adjusting to Clip Studio Paint's UI. Switching from Adobe Photoshop + Clip Studio Paint → Rebelle did not. I could jump directly into the program and draw with little interruption. Most of the shortcuts and navigational tools matched what I was accustomed to, and the ones that differed required little to no learning curve.

There were a few adjustments that took time to figure out, however.

I was stuck for some time finding a way to create two windows for the same project. This feature is critical to my workflow, as being able to jump from the working area to the zoomed-out image is essential for making sure a composition looks pleasing from a distance. In Photoshop, this option could be found at `Window > Arrange > New Window for ...`. In Clip Studio Paint, this option could be found at `Window > Canvas > New Window`.

Given the relative newness of the program, resources and how-to guides were hard to come by. I couldn't find any results in the Rebelle manual on creating a new window or large thumbnail, and a quick Google search produced no relevant results. It only took a careful search of the UI to find the correct option (`Window > Preview`).

Relative newness aside, I found Rebelle rewarding to try out. Whereas other programs require setup to create the illusion of traditional art, Rebelle gives you the tools to do so immediately. It's a powerful tool for the right artist, and it can be used to remarkable effect. I'm not sure if I will use Rebelle regularly, but I think it fulfills a well-deserved niche in the graphics software ecosystem.
