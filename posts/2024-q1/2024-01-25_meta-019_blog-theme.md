# Meta 019 — Blog Theme

In my years on the internet, I've followed the comic _XKCD_. It's funny, clever, and educational, all wrapped up in a minimalistic visual style.

Its tagline has stuck with me. It reads, as follows, "A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language." For all the topics and pages the comic outputs, this tagline struck me as succinct yet effective.

As stated in [my previous post](2024-01-24_meta-018_blog-classification.md), I struggle to summarize my blog. I ruminated over the two classifications that seemed the most relevant, then ultimately left its classification as a writer's original.

However, I think there are still things to summarize. Perhaps not the role of the blog, but instead, the themes that compose it—its metaphorical tagline.

On a surface level, the content in this blog draws inspiration from a multitude of places. Anime, digital art, fantasy works, puzzles, real-world experiences, sci-fi works, video games, wordplay, and so on, form its foundation. However, I can't quantify any of these elements as thematic. You could strip these elements out, and I would still have a story to tell.

Instead, I think of Maggock's comic, [_Inner Space_](https://innerspace.reneelecompte.com/). This comic tells the story of a gryphon, Meg, as she explores the contents of her own head. Initially, it started out as a slife-of-life story, but, [by her own admission](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maggock/inner-space), it evolved into a parable reflecting the author's own life.

If my characters are any indication, this blog is the same.

In a narrow scope, this blog chronicles the lives of several characters as they learn about the world they inhabit and grow as people.

Extending the scope out, the blog acts as an extended digital hike into the recesses of my mind, where I extract life epiphanies and massage them into a quasi-comfortable format.

Looking at each scope, you can see how both result in the same themes. Both stories are journeys, ones of discovery, understanding, acceptance, and growth.

Sometimes, you start out on a journey not knowing where you'll end up. When asked, you might say "I don't know" and "It doesn't matter."

It's somewhere along the way that the destination becomes apparent at all. Then, in hindsight, the decisions you made on the way turned out to shape your destination.

Then at the end, you look back. You understand where your journey has taken you, and you understand why you've taken that journey.
