# Vignette 064 – Schedule

> It was around 20:30 when Solana stopped by Vic's apartment.
>
> At that moment, Vic had just completed his evening ritual—and he didn't exactly make plans for further into the night. Yet, Solana had configured the lab portal to his address, took Clementine with her, and asked whether he wanted to spend the evening together.
>
> To his surprise, Vic wasn't taken aback by the invite. If they were strangers, sure, the visit would have been quite disruptive. Knowing Solana, however, he wholly welcomed it. To him, this was a regular activity—a refreshingly regular one, even.
>
> "I appreciate the visit," he tells her.

---

> "You must admit, though," Vic adds, his tone tinged with a certain flair, "we _must_ work out a schedule should these visits become a regular occurrence?"
>
> He could see as Solana's expression switched. The change in tone indicated he was up to one of his games, after all, and Solana knew she would need to work it out.
>
> Solana throws Vic a blithe expression.
>
> "Go on?" she says, the corners of her lips upturned.
>
> "Very well," he replies.
>
> "Here's what I propose. We plan these visits on a weekly basis. This time window in which you arrived today was perfect, as were the previous times you arrived."
>
> He then focuses on Solana intently. "As for the day of the week... well, there's only one option that makes sense, isn't there?"

---

> As expected, upon realizing what he was getting at, Solana breaks into a soft laugh.
>
> "Knowing your fondness for ice cream, you must have been holding onto that pun for a while," she answers.
>
> Quite honestly, he only came across the pun recently—but this wasn't the time to share that.
>
> "What else?" Vic inquires.
>
> Solana rolls her eyes and sighs warmly. "...And knowing your love of double-layered puns, you had to choose that day of the week because of me."
>
> Upon hearing her response, Vic's gaze softens, and he presses his nose against Solana's cheek.
>
> "Very good," he replies. "You are a brilliant spot of sun in my life, after all."

<!--
Before he even finished the sentence, Solana had begun to shrink into her clothes.

---

> It was only five minutes in, and Vic could already tell this evening would be an enjoyable one.
