# Meta 016 â€” Creative Writing as Puzzle Solving

I have a penchant for puzzles. As a pastime, completing puzzles exercises mental fitness, and upon completion, they provide dopamine as their payoff. Perhaps it's no surprise, then, that puzzles are a mainstay of my blog.

Within this blog, I've addressed the topic of puzzles in two places: in [Meta 004](../2022-h1/2022-03-17_meta-004_puzzles.md), where I discuss the role puzzles had in the creation of _Shaved Ice_, and in various Vignettes, where I weave puzzles of varied natures into the primary narrative of my universe.

I want to bring attention to the method by which these puzzles were conveyed. In _Shaved Ice_, the puzzles were in-universe puzzles. In the Vignettes in this blog, the puzzles are implied and commented on by characters. In both cases, the puzzles were made obvious to the reader.

The type of puzzle I want to discuss in this post are those of a different variety.

In many narratives, the beats in the narrative are designed to be interesting in of themselves, and a conclusion is more or less a result of when there are no more beats to add. In this style of narrative, the writing focuses more on making each moment a delight to experience, and the conclusion is often disappointing when it inevitably comes.

In contrast, there is another style of narrative, one I find more satisfying. This style of narrative focuses on making the conclusion enjoyable to reach. It's the sort of narrative that sequences events in just the right way where the conclusion unfolds naturally, and you're left thinking how well the writers planned all this out.

This style of writing treats individual narrative beats like parts of a puzzle and the full narrative as the completed puzzle.

Given its solution-oriented method, not only is this style of writing satisfying to consume, but it is also fun to write. It is the literary equivalent of piecing together a museum piece out of a hundred tiny parts.

Thus, the primary narrative of this blog acts as an overarching puzzle. I have an arsenal of beats at hand, composed of worldbuilding, characterization, [Chekhov's Guns,](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun) and wordplay. These elements act as the perfect tools to sequence together. With any luck, I'm able to sequence these elements in a way that just clicks.
