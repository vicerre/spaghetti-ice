## Design notes

- I produced this drawing with a simple goal in mind: I wanted to draw Alis and Vic together. As Alis and Vic are defined through comparison and contrast, I wanted my composition to reflect these traits. After several composition attempts, I settled on depicting the two of them engaged in a friendly game of chess, depicting how each sits and plays.
- Initially, I did not intend to use proper perspective when composing this piece; constructing perspective lines took effort, so I resisted incorporating them. As I worked, however, I found the use of proper perspective highly effective in improving the quality of the piece.
- In using proper perspective, I discovered one tip: to draw a figure in 3D space, it helps first to identify the plane on which the figure lies. This ensures the figure is drawn relative to a known, fixed point. (This realization is in parts an extension of [EmilioDekure's tip on drawing legs in space](https://twitter.com/UDekure/status/1507085634392899584).)

  In this piece, the reference planes for the chairs proved to be key in drawing Alis and Vic in the same plane. As a bonus, these reference planes doubled as drop shadows.

- Midway through drawing, I decided I would not have the attention span to illustrate this image with a full set of colors and shading. Instead, I turned to a simpler, more stylistic approach. As I already placed rectangles in this piece, I added more geometric shapes. In the end, I produced a result reminiscent of 1960s modern art.
