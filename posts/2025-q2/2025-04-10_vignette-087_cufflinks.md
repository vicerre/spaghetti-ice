# Vignette 087 – Cufflinks

> As fate would have it, Vic would find Alis undoing his cufflinks this morning.
>
> Alis had been busy prototyping a few projects of his over the past few weeks. His lab was evolving day by day to accommodate his latest developments, the least of which included quasi-sentient lights, material automata, and an arm-mounted chassis of sorts.
>
> As of today, it would seem the extent of Alis's projects now included Vic.

> In place of the old set of cufflinks was now a new pair.
>
> At a glance, the difference was unobvious—both sets took the form of orange rhombi of equal shapes and sizes, after all. At most, one could argue that the new set was shinier.
>
> Deliberate inspection, however, revealed key differences. For instance, inscribed on the new set was a subtle and intricate pattern of circuitry. More pressingly, the pair seemed to emanate a near-invisible "hum", the frequency of which catches Vic's curiosity.

---

> The devices on these cufflinks seemed to be attuning with Vic, and the effect is familiar yet unfamiliar. If he had to explain, Vic would say it's though he had donned a pair of self-adjusting eyeglasses—only, it wasn't his _vision_ that was being mended.
>
> If this were six minutes ago, Vic would have remembered too late that using his cryogenic abilities would fail under these circumstances. Instead, though, something else happens.

---

> With an arm outstretched and the devices close by, a sizable outcropping of shards manifests forth from his palm. The shards had the structure of crystal, but they weren't formed from mineral or ice. Instead, they were constructs of solid light—massy to the touch yet as weightless as air.
>
> First, Vic makes a short, excited sound.
>
> Then, a tingly sensation takes him.
>
> After that, he finds in him the yen to wander back to his interdimensional portal, target an otherwise-unexplored set of coordinates, and throw himself into the unassuming multiverse again.
