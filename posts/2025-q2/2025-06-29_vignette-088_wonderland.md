# Vignette 088 – Wonderland

> I don't know what you did to incur Alis's attention, but you aren't given the chance to realize you had before he got to you.
>
> He's not a bad person, really. If anything, his skills and abilities make him closer to the proverbial genie of myth, the one who grants you the spirit of your wish, not the letter. It's with these skills and abilities that he's able to pry open the gates to your head, then identify your innermost hopes and desires—possibly ones you never realized were there.

---

> Was it love or comfort or ecstasy you were looking for? Perhaps power or fortune or peace? Maybe you had regrets you wanted to amend, or injustices you wanted to correct. Maybe there isn't a word in our language for the experiences you wished to see pass.
>
> Regardless of what desires are in there, they've just been resolved. In short order, he's crafted you an illusion that accelerates each of these desires, one so thick it scantly ceases to be one at all.
>
> Defying this illusion would be like defying your bones. It sets in so quickly that trying to resist would be like forcing yourself to asphyxiate from plain air. Your rational thoughts cling to the belief that this is all a fabrication, but you can't deny the feelings that are coming to transpire. To reject your feelings now is to reject the idea that they were valid at all.

---

> He then pushes further.
>
> Did you want to accomplish something else after your current needs were satisfied, perhaps? Well, in this reality, you've just succeeded. Then a more trifling idea comes to your mind, only for that idea to be quickly satisfied too. Every desire that surfaces next is met to your exact specifications.
>
> At the start, this feels splendid—those deep-set goals that were whims at best transformed into victories. But as you keep reaching those goals and seeking new ones, each victory feels less and less earned.

---

> You quickly conjure up new goals and dreams, only for your mind to tell you that they've been readily fulfilled. You grasp to reignite the spark that once came to you, but nothing you do gives you the same satisfaction. All of your wishes are granted as you come to them, and in doing so, you're left adrift, subsumed in the world of your ideals.
>
> You try again to think of something that gives you purpose, only this time, you find that you can't.

---

> And then, you're spared.
>
> You've returned to the reality you grew up with, the one you began to question was a delusion. You're certain this is real, and yet you can't find any evidence that you had come across someone called "Alis" earlier today.
>
> You then start to notice the many flaws in this reality. You realize many things that could transparently be made better in an ideal world, but, due to a breakdown in systems or just plain apathy, they aren't.
>
> You keep your vigor up. You tell yourself how grateful you are for the good things you find in it.

---

> Yet, as much as you try not to, you can't help but recall that illusion. It felt so _seamless_ and _perfect_, and you were torn away from it so suddenly. Why should you have to abide by this dysfunctional reality now when there was a place that showed how much better things could be?
>
> As the days cycle into months, this thought clings to the back of your mind. Despite everything, nothing has changed in your reality. Every day now is but a faded facsimile of what you know could be, and every action you take is a constant reminder that, in this reality, you've left your goals unanswered.
>
> You wonder if it would have been a mercy for Alis to leave you in that illusion that day.
