> Which character is your favorite and why? If you can't pick a favorite character, answer with the character you enjoy writing/drawing/developing the most. ([2024-04-13](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1228635502639452214), Kiwi)

Picking a favorite character would be like picking a favorite child; I love them all in different ways. In particular:

- Alis is the most rewarding character to develop.
- Solana is (as of writing) the character with the most unexplored potential.
- Vic is the character who is most fun to write.

> Where do your characters lie on the [Futch Scale](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/futch-scale)? ([2024-04-13](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1228818654586601604), moscd)

- Alis: Lies orthogonal to this scale. Is a nerd.
- Solana: Femme.
- Vic: Lies orthogonal to this scale. Is a nerd.

> Your world loses its plot armor. What happens? ([2024-04-15](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1229394934205911081), [source](https://www.reddit.com/comments/1c4c66z/))

The Storyteller is responsible for weaving plot threads in my universe. If she were no longer in control:

- Alis: Would have lost faith in humanity a long time ago, ditching Solana and Vic.
- Solana: The Arclight virus in her system would activate, driving her insane and undoing all of her character development.
- Vic: Any and all of his antics would no longer produce comedic consequences. Before he realizes any change precipitated, he would be awkward, in legal trouble, or dead.
