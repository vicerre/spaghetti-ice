# Meta 023 â€“ Creative Writing Timelapse

Source file: [[link]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/109FaUEJepsfjKjyuQbfXJVunblekCpYfujH9J8X6zuA/edit)

## Overview

In the digital art space, it's common to see artists share videos of their development process. These videos let other artists study and learn from the artist's workflow. Furthermore, these videos often reveal aspects of the image that didn't make it into the final product.

Like how artists can share videos of their processes, writers can share replays of theirs. The writing software you use might preserve entire edit history of your file. If so, you can simply play back the edit history, producing a timelapse of your work.

[Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) offers an extensive edit history system, keeping track of every edit you made with millisecond precision. With the appropriate browser extension, you can convert your edit history into a timelapse. To keep track of my writing history, I drafted [Vignette 076](2024-05-02_vignette-076_matchup.md) in Google Docs.

## Miscellaneous notes

- The drafting process for this Vignette took longer than the drafting process for most others. It took multiple attempts to frame the core conceit of the passage in a way that led to a satisfying conclusion.
- Towards the end of the writing process, I remove completed passages from the document to post publicly. This seems to cause the edit history to behave strangely.
