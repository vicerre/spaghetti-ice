# Vignette 074 – Weird Dream

> Solana's breath hangs in her lungs.
>
> Before her was a portal, and from it emerged a kitsune, his tails four and his fur snow-white. His presence, while unexpected, was far from foreign.
>
> "Oh, I made it!" he says. "Good good good."
>
> The kitsune lifts his head towards Solana, tails aloft. "Hello, Solana," he says. "Don't mind me–I'm just testing out these dreamwalking abilities again."
>
> Vic seemed quite eager to take in this dream. He seemed delighted to see her, of course, but his attention is quickly taken—first by his immediate context, then by his greater surroundings. He seemed content to let his eyes wander distinctly—until he suddenly pauses and realizes something very, very specific.
>
> Solana, throughout this, felt as though she were laid bare.

---

> "Ah..."
>
> Vic returns his attention to Solana.
>
> "This is the sort of dream you'd much prefer we leave unobserved, isn't it?" he asks—a justified observation, considering I refuse to describe it or Solana's thoughts on it in any detail.
>
> A mix of thoughts comes to Solana. She wants Vic to forget she saw any part of this dream _immediately_—and making this happen would easy through Arclight. At the same time, however, she knows she couldn't simply take away Vic's memory just because he happened to stop by at an inopportune time.
>
> A month's worth of deliberation later, she replies, "It's really weird, isn't it?"
>
> Noticing the restraint in her response, Vic steps up to her.
>
> "...Now hang on, Solana."

> Vic poofs from his kitsune appearance to his usual one, gesturing to himself.
>
> "Aren't I supposed to be 'the weird one'?" he says. "I'm the one with infatuated with sweets, monstrosities, and the color red. I'm also the one with a mysterious lab in the middle of—well, let's just say, somewhere you don't expect."
>
> He then signals to the indescribable parts of the dream.
>
> "Meanwhile, you," he adds. "You've quite the imagination to dream up—" waving his hands a bit "—well, _this_."
>
> He tilts his head just a bit, then leans forward, his forehead against Solana's.
>
> He tilts his head just a bit, then presses his forehead against Solana's. His expression develops into one that could be described as 'affectionate teasing'.
>
> "Since when did you take up my mantle?"

---

> As suddenly as a balloon might pop, the pressure in her lungs lifts.
>
> ...What was she even worrying about just now? She was so preoccupied with the idea Vic might find the weirder parts of her off-putting that she didn't look at herself. She never judged Vic by his own eccentricities, after all. In fact, she delighted in them. It was by spending time with him and delving into their interests they were able to eventually achieve things such as [busting the thread of fate](../2024-q1/2024-01-27_vignette-069_a-story.md) and becoming more than just friends.
>
> It's then she realizes Vic must understand that, too. Knowing how she must have felt, he was willing to do the same for her.
>
> She resists the urge to pounce on him and say something indescribably dumb.
>
> And then, she does.
