# Vignette 075 â€“ Morning Report

> Before Alis was Armin.
>
> He had opened a portal from his bedroom to Alis's, from which he stooped, knees and hands folded, eyes fixed. He was still ensconced in his nightwear, his hair undone and feet aired. He was as though a gargoyle, locked in place but ready to swoop in at the first hint of rain.
>
> He glances at the nightstand; the time is 7:55.
>
> With deliberate vexation in his tone, Alis says, "Good morning, Armin."
>
> "Alis," Armin replies.

---

> "Solana and I have been doing well as of late," he reports.
>
> Alis attempts to avert his gaze from the fresh eyesore, but he can't find the space.
>
> "I think this all started when you tried to murder me; we started taking each other more seriously then," Armin then tells him. "This was all part of your master plan to make us realize how much we mattered to each other, wasn't it?"
>
> Alis half-shrugs. "It's only under the most dire of circumstances people show their true nature," he measuredly replies.
>
> Suddenly, his head comes within inches of spearpoint. Armin had formed a blade of ice that could only be called "his best". All the while, he held the sort of expression one would make when inviting a friend to morning tea.
>
> "In that case, I hope you don't mind if I were to return the favor?"

> His attention lands on the spearpoint as one might visit a thrice-seen painting; having lost its gestalt, it acted most effectively as a place to rest the eyes.
>
> He then sits up and grabs the rim of Armin's portal.
>
> "Go to hell," he warmly tells him, before pulling up the portal and forcing it shut.
>
> Moments later, another portal opens, this one roughly the size of his head.
>
> "I'll see you at the roof of The Metropolitan around eight thirty, then?" Armin says.
>
> "Only if you bring Solana as well."
>
> "Ten thirty, then."
