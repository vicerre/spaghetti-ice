# Meta 021 – Terminus

Circa April 20, 2013, I started to construct what would become the universe of this blog. Come June 28, 2021, I started to collect and write about the concepts that accumulated since then. I expanded upon those concepts and shared them with friends. And now, as of April 11, 2024—nearly eleven years since I started recording this thing—I'm ready to set this blog aside.

To date, I've written hundreds of posts and hundreds of thousands of words. I've identified my characters and their relationship to myself (i.e. proxies). I've figured out the fundamental drive behind my creativity (an exploration of the self). I've uncovered everything I aimed for when I started this blog.

I have no plans to send off this blog with some big, cleverly-written finale. I've shared [Illustration 033](../2023-q4/2023-11-03_illustration-033_selfie-3.md) and [Vignette 069](../2024-q1/2024-01-27_vignette-069_a-story.md), which fulfill a similar sort of role—not to mention the chain of lookback posts starting from [Meta 016](../2024-q1/2024-01-22_meta-016_creative-writing-puzzle-solving.md). Any further conclusion would simply be redundant. Instead, this blog will linger on, and any posts I make from this point on will simply act as a bonus.

For those who have followed along as I wrote this blog, I am sincerely grateful for your patronage. If it weren't for your support, I couldn't have written all that I had. More importantly, if it weren't for your support, I wouldn't have found what I was looking for.

Thank you.
