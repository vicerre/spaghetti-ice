# Icebreaker 127

> Who is the weakest relevant character or figure in your world? ([2024-05-21](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1242452012239421501), [source](https://www.reddit.com/comments/1cwycn4/))

Between my primary cast of characters, Vic would be the one considered the weakest. He has the most morals and is the most reluctant to use force against others.

> Which of your characters would negotiate a fight they got into, and which characters would mediate a fight other characters got into? ([2024-05-25](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1243776918587703397), Kiwi)

(I cannot identify a situation in which my characters would fight among themselves non-constructively.)

> If all of your characters were poured into the same multiverse to interact with other characters, how would it go? ([2024-06-08](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1248850709265252404), Kiwi)

As role play characters by origin, Solana and Vic would love the opportunity to meet other people's characters. As they've been cooped up in their own universe for the past three years, however, they're quite rusty at this whole "interacting with extradimensional characters" thing.

Solana and Vic would be stoked for Alis, however. He is a character designed for a literary universe, so he has not had the opportunity to interact with extradimensional characters. Having him interact with characters beyond their universe would be like pushing someone who hasn't swum before into the deep end of a pool.

Separately:

- Alis would fail at everything that comes his way, but he would become more personable following these experiences.
- Solana would be pleasant to interact with, but she wouldn't pressure the plot in any way.
- Vic would get himself killed, and I would need to revive him.
