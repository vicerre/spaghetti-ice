# Rendition 062 – Combination Lock (2024-06-10 – 2024-06-12)

<img src="assets/2024-06-10_image-173.png">

## Overview

This image in this post is a manga page layout. The page depicts Solana and Alis uncovering and discussing a puzzle found in Vic's Headscape.

The premise behind this image was inspired by a humorous realization; I, V, and C are all [Roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals), and the word "romance" can act as a play on the proper noun "Romance". Considering Vic's non-romantic bait-and-switch antics and love of wordplay, I thought a puzzle that applies these elements would be fun to incorporate into my universe.

Initially, I wanted to compose a Vignette centered around this puzzle. However, I could not find sufficient inspiration to write one. Instead, I adapted the concept to an alternate medium. Given the brevity of the concept, the way visual media controls pacing, and my interest in the medium, I drew a manga page instead.

## Design notes

General:

- Originally, the puzzle box would have been drawn more elaborately, with additional insets and buttons on its surface. Ultimately, to ensure puzzle solvers were not misled, I ended up removing these extra details.
