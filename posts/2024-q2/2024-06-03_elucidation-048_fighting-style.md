# Elucidation 048 – Vic's Fighting Style

In character design, a character's fighting style acts as characterization. For example, a clever character might use an ability or weapon that requires finesse, while a brutish character might use a brutish ability or weapon that requires little skill.

In [Vignette 076](2024-05-02_vignette-076_matchup.md), I wrote a scene in which my characters engaged in physical combat. When I wrote this scene, I had to think about my characters' fighting styles—Vic's, in particular.

As Vic evolves, so does his fighting style. Originally, he preferred to use ice shards from afar, and later, he switched to a bident, engaging with the opponent more closely.

Since then, he's mellowed out further. Whereas he used the bident with technical precision, he is now content to have fun and freewheel instead. Therefore, his weapon of choice mellowed out as well.

It's here I picked up an external source of inspiration. I played _Hades II_ and faced a boss named Chronos, who wields a scythe that transforms from a cane.

This weapon transformation seemed like a fun mechanic to include in my universe. Furthermore, a scythe seemed perfect as the sort of impractical weapon a witty, energetic character would gallivant around with.

With this inspiration in mind, [I sketched a few images of Vic manifesting his ice into the form of a scythe.](2024-06-02_illustration-056_ice-scythe.md)
