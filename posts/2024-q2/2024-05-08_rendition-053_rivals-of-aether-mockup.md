# Rendition 053 – Rivals of Aether Mockup (2024-05-06 – 2024-05-07)

<img src="assets/2024-05-06_image-159.png">

## Overview

A sprite of Alis in the style of _Rivals of Aether_, for use in palette swaps. This sprite accompanies those of similar style for [Solana](../2023-q3/2023-07-04_rendition-037_rivals-of-aether-mockup.md) and [Vic](../2023-q1/2023-02-22_rendition-031_rivals-of-aether-mockup.md).

## Design notes

- The lack of gloves on Alis's visible hand is intentional. Originally, I drew his hand without gloves by mistake. However, I ended up retaining it for visual clarity.
