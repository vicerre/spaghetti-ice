## Overview

This post consists of an assortment of sketches I made of Alis and/or Vic.

## Design notes

Alis and Vic, being alternate universe counterparts, share many of the same visual design elements. Despite these visual similarities, they are not identical. This is most evidently seen if one were to swap their personalities, as each character retains his own set of facial expressions and body language.
