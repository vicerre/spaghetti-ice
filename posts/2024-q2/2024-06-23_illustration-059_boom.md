# Illustration 059 â€“ Boom (2024-06-22 â€“ 2024-06-23)

<img src="assets/2024-06-22_image-179.png">

## Overview

This image acts as page four out of my manga miniseries.

## Design notes

- The use of the ðŸ’¥ emoji acts as an in-joke. Whenever any of my friends on the Discord app solves one of my puzzles, I attach the ðŸ’¥ emoji to their message as a reaction. In this page, I interpret the ðŸ’¥ emoji literally, offering it as a reward to Alis and Solana for solving the combination lock.
  - Aside: I picked up the use of the ðŸ’¥ emoji as a reaction for "you got it" from a certain Hector Villafuerte.
- In designing the architecture for this panel, I referenced [Icebreaker 046](../2022-h2/2022-11-26_icebreaker-044-045-046-047.md). In this post, I discuss Jacobean-style architecture as one that pairs well with Vic's design. Therefore, I referred back to this post when designing the layout of Vic's Headscape.
- In drawing this panel, I learned more about the Ruler tool in Clip Studio Paint. In addition to the Perspective Ruler tool I had been using, I discovered the Special Ruler tool. This tool offers some unique and helpful ruler types, including curved rulers and circular rulers. In this drawing, I used perpendicular parallel line rulers at a Dutch angle for the background.
- When searching for resources on to draw explosions, I found it difficult to find resources for the type of explosion I wanted. Many of the resources focused on explosions that were overly fiery or dusty for my use case, so I had to be deliberate in my search.
