# Illustration 055 â€“ Firenze (2024-05-21 â€“ 2024-05-30)

<img src="assets/2024-05-21_image-164.png">

## Overview

Motivations for producing this image:

- Outside of group shots, I had yet to draw Solana and Alis in the same scene.
- I wanted to complement [the banner-style painting of Solana and Vic sitting underneath a cherry blossom tree.](2024-05-06_illustration-054_cherry-blossoms.md)
- I wanted to depict the location of Firenze.

Ultimately, I produced the image depicted in this post, a panorama-style painting of Solana and Alis exploring the streets of Firenze while eating ice cream.

## Design notes

- I drew this scene in curvilinear perspective. This type of perspective was chosen for two reasons:
  - It is the most appropriate perspective to use for an image of wide aspect ratio.
  - It introduces a sense of flow unavailable in rectilinear perspective.
- (The perspective used in this piece really just consists of rectangular prisms on a perspective grid.)
- Perspective grids aside, I learned much about the principles of art that apply to depth of field, e.g.:
  - How shapes fade to the color of the sky as they recede into the distance.
  - Where to simplify background detail to ensure focus on foreground details.
  - Where to introduce mistakes to give distant elements the illusion of being out of focus.
- To make the color palette cohesive, I made colors vibrate in a way that reflected other visual elements. Notably, the buildings in the piece incorporate bits of orange and green on their surfaces, drawing the viewer's attention toward the orange and green focal points.
- This was the first time I had attempted to draw a city street, much less a busy one. In doing so, I exercised my ability to draw buildings and crowds.
