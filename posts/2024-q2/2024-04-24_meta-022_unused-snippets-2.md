# Meta 022 â€“ Unused Snippets 2

[non-canon]

Another batch of scrapped snippets I liked too much to discard completely:

---

> "...You realize I can reprogram your mind to be an exact duplicate of mine?" Alis says.
>
> "As if you could stand any more of yourself?" Vic remarks.
>
> "As a matter of fact, Armin, I can."

---

> The only time Vic would use the word 'love' is if it immediately preceded the word 'craft'.

---

> "I think we've solved for ourselves, haven't we?" Vic says.
>
> "Yes, well..." Alis replies, "it turns out that when you whip milk for too long, you make cream."

---

> "You know," Solana says, "you look rather dashing in that outfit."
>
> _Don't decline the compliment, don't decline the compliment,_ Vic thinks.
>
> "...Why, thank you, Solana," he replies.
