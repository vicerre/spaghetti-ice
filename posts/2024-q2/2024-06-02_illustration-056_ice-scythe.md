<img src="assets/2024-06-01_image-165.png">

## Overview

The image in this post depicts sketches of Vic. In each sketch, Vic is seen manifesting and wielding his ice abilities in the form of a scythe.

## Miscellaneous notes

Currently, Vic is currently unable to manifest ice in scythe form by himself. However, he would be able to do so with Alis's assistance.
