# Vignette 076 – Matchup

> Vic was excited to square off against Alis in a physical match. Alis hadn't used those supernatural abilities of his in a sporting context before, and he wanted to see how they would shake out. As a bonus, Alis inviting Solana meant he'd get to see her in action, too.
>
> They had met at the Metropolitan on schedule and laid out the rules of the bout. Before they could start, however, Alis had something to say.

---

> "I've run through every scenario," he said. "Between us three, the only division of persons that offers each side a sporting chance is the one where Armin and I are allied."
>
> Knowing Alis, that statement had a high probability of being correct.
>
> …Knowing Alis, there was something he wasn't sharing.
>
> And, well, knowing himself, it would be impossible to ferret a straight answer out from him.
>
> Vic didn't mind. Sure, he was expecting to be on the opposite side of Alis's wiles, but opposing him was never his goal to begin with. Both he and Solana would rather solve for the answer Alis had laid out, regardless.
>
> With each side in place, the match began.

---

> Vic was quite fond of the heat of the match. Between Alis's inventive use of abilities and Solana's firepower, it was everything he anticipated and then some.
>
> When they established the rules of the match, they determined Alis could use Oneiros, but only for his side. Thus, when Vic was acting alongside Alis, it only seemed advantageous for Alis to manipulate him.
>
> Indeed, Alis's manipulation seemed to activate something in Vic he could not achieve otherwise. At least, it did _something_ for the ice abilities that at times malfunctioned. With Alis's wiles running alongside his own, he daresayed he was acclimating to being taken under his thrall.
>
> Well at least, he _was_, up to a certain point.

---

> You see, some amount of moments into the bout, Alis had routed Vic into proximity with Solana. From there, he nudged him along, making the slightest, most precise bit of contact between him and her. And with _that_, he was able to leave Solana stunned—long enough to call the match in their favor.
>
> After the match, Solana was left smiling, her face smothered against Vic's shoulder.
>
> "You asked me to join you two for this exact purpose, didn't you?" she said.
>
> Alis denies any ulterior motives, stating he only took the most effective action to end the match in their favor. (This was utter bunk, as Vic would have it.)
>
> Nudging Solana back, Vic quips, "I take it Alis had a very different definition of 'match' in mind."

---

> In theory, this match counted as a win for Vic and Alis. In practice, however, Alis was outvoted two to one on the match's validity.
>
> Solana and Vic then promptly insisted on redoing the match with updated teams—and of course, following this, they claimed a lopsided victory in their favor.
