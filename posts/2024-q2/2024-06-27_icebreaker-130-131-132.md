> Which ship dynamics best encompass your characters? ([2024-06-13](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1250905719029633024), [source](<https://twitter.com/search?q=(character%20OR%20relationship%20OR%20ship)%20dynamics>))

Solana and Vic's relationship can be characterized as a relationship dynamic progression<sup>[1](https://twitter.com/emimillerart/status/1550895005270966272), [2](https://twitter.com/mcapriglioneart/status/1685687719899402240)</sup>.

> Do your characters prefer stardust or seafoam? ([2024-06-15](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1251692604396142692), [source](https://artfight.net/news/92))

- Alis: Stardust. The sea is an awfully muddy particulate mixture, [the mechanics of which are incredibly difficult to predict.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations) In contrast, stars have the courtesy to stay lightyears away, and the one that doesn't can be observed with relative ease.
- Solana: Seafoam. She enjoys the sound of the shore (and sound shores). Stardust isn't a bad option either, though; her mass contains star matter, and she enjoys a nice night sky.
- Vic: Stardust. [He has taken Solana to the observatory](../2022-h2/2022-11-07_vignette-006_stargazing.md), and [he enjoys the spectacle of a solar eclipse.](../2024-q1/2024-03-19_illustration-046_eclipse.md)

> Do your characters prefer the sun or fish? ([2024-06-15](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1251661374904340541))

- Alis: Enjoys the natural light in his lab compared to the artificial lights in Armin's. Is willing to sacrifice fish so long as he has access to other aquatic lifeforms.
- Solana: Is sun-themed. Prefers the sun.
- Vic: Can't decide. Solana makes for a great sun substitute. However, it's not as though his existence revolves around hers. Plus, he enjoys the bizarre evolutionary traits fish produceâ€”especially those from the deep sea.
