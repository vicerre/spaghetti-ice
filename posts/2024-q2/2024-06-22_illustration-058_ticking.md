# Illustration 058 – Ticking (2024-06-20 – 2024-06-21)

<img src="assets/2024-06-20_image-178.png">

## Overview

In the interest of sharing more bad puns and in-jokes, I created a third part to two manga pages previously posted<sup>[1](2024-06-13_rendition-062_combination-lock.md), [2](2024-06-16_illustration-057_combination-unlock.md)</sup>.

## Design notes

In this page's creation process, I incorporated more complex paneling and lettering techniques:

- I visually depicted Alis's ability to enthrall others. The ability is typically signalled through a change in Alis's eye color and the feeling of pinched nerves on the target—neither of which would display in a visual format. Instead, to indicate Alis's use of this ability, I depicted Solana against a black background with an ECG wave.
- I incorporated sound effects into each panel. The lettuce makes a ticking sound effect. Separately, Alis compels Solana to throw the lettuce forcefully in the last panel.
- I incorporated additional insets within each tier. The first inset is used to depict how Alis noticed the ticking sound in the background. The second inset is used to depict Alis compelling Solana to throw the lettuce.
- I used the visual depth to show elements in and out of focus. Most importantly, I overlaid speech balloons on the lettuce to show Solana talking over the ticking time bomb.
