# Vignette 013 – Holiday Gifts

> Vic had hardly finished his morning routine when the apartment buzzer rang.
>
> The buzzer intrigues him; he wasn't expecting any deliveries today, and the timing was too perfect to be coincidence.
>
> He peers through the window in the main room. In front of the apartment building entrance was Solana, and in her hands was a smallish cardboard box.
>
> The fact that Solana was visiting him here was unusual. Following this observation, he notes an increase in his oxytocin levels.
>
> Promptly, he opens a portal next to Solana and waves "hi".

---

> Solana had brought him festive goodies.
>
> The first item she shares with him was a flask of a spiced apple beverage. "I got it fresh from Red Ṡalinnis," she says.
>
> Vic thinks that would pair well with the holiday dinner. With that refreshment in mind, he decides he would plan accordingly.
>
> She then presents him with a spruce wreath and a string of holiday lights. "Because we can't just leave your place undecorated, can we?" Solana said.
>
> Vic admits he hadn't exactly been focusing on this place, and he figures they would work on that together shortly.
>
> Solana then shows him a small glass vial, no larger than her hand. Inside was a sprig of a plant, one with teardrop-shaped leaves and small white berries.
>
> "I thought you might find it interesting," she says, lightly smiling.
>
> Vic recognizes the species, and his eyebrows rise.

---

> His smiles with amusement. "Ah, the mistletoe," he says, "a species of plant best known for its ability to latch onto other plants and drain the host of its nutrients."
>
> Solana nods with assertion. "Yep, that's the most interesting thing about it! You don't have any in your collection of specimens, do you? It might be a fun species to include in one of your projects."
>
> Vic nods in return. He takes the vial, pries concerningly at Solana, and portals it away for later. "Thank you for the sample," he adds.
>
> Solana breaks composure—she hangs her head down, brings her hand to her face, and giggles.
>
> Ah, they were being quite silly about this particular item, weren't they? Looking at her reaction, Vic can't help but chuckle as well.
>
> Shortly afterward, Solana catches her breath. "Oh, before I forget!" she adds, "There's one last thing I have for you!"

---

> As soon as Solana produces the final item out of the box, Vic freezes.
>
> "—Excuse me, Solana," he interjects, "but isn't that—?"
>
> She holds a red-orange scarf up to Vic. The fabric was thick and worn, and the dye was fading. "—From my past lives?" she replies.
>
> She turns her attention to Vic and beams. "Yeah it is," she says. She turns to the scarf, lingering on it. "There's a lot of memories woven into this thing."
>
> Vic blinks repeatedly at her, then gently asks, "You wish to give it to me?"
>
> Solana nods. She points to the outer ends of the scarf, then says, "And, uh... well, it got all twisted in the wash, and now it looks like a double helix." She smirks. "Clearly, that's fate at work."
>
> Pressing his fingers under his lips, he smiles. "Clearly."

---

> He takes the scarf from her and steadily runs his hand along it.
>
> [It was just last night he had a nightmare where the universe started to destabilize and threatened Solana's existence.](2022-12-22_vignette-012_endpoint.md) The two of them, along with Alis, had to choose between who would live and who would be erased. All the time he spent with her—both her and her past selves—would have been erased along with it.
>
> This nightmare made him realize how precious his memories of her were, and how much he cherished them. To receive a keepsake of those memories meant the universe to him.
>
> He was glad Alis wasn't listening—he'd surely claim he was getting far too sentimental.
>
> Without further thought, Vic slings the scarf around his neck, then gestures widely at Solana.
>
> "How do I look?" he asks her.
>
> The expression Solana makes back means everything to him.
