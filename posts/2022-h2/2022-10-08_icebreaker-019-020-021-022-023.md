# Icebreaker 019

> What are your characters' thoughts on pineapple on pizza? ([2022-10-05](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1027183246234095708))

> Solana: Thinks the flavor combination is odd. She wouldn't be averse to eating it, but given the choice, she would prefer meat toppings.
>
> Vicerre: Appreciates the sweetness pineapple brings to an otherwise savory dish. He wishes the acids in the pineapple weren't denatured by the baking process, though.

> Seconds after Solana sent Vicerre the email, several portals opened around her living space to take the oranges away.
>
> Solana can't stay disappointed. She knows Vicerre wouldn't send her some snacks, only to shamelessly take them away. She couldn't predict what he was doing with them, though.

> Moments later, she notices a response.

> > A. Vicerre

> Ten minutes later, a portal appears over Solana's dining table. The oranges return on a plate, now in their completed form. They were sliced into discs and browned, and rosemary is sprinkled on top. Caramelized juices ooze from them. There's even a fork on top for convenience.
>
> Solana can't fathom what inspired Vicerre to treat her to this dish, but she is in no position to question it.

# Icebreaker 021

> Your characters have been taken by surprise! Someone they know snuck up behind them and touched them or said "Boo!" or something similar. How do they react? [2022-10-06](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1027432085910208603), moscd)

Vicerre surprising Solana:

> Solana is desensitized to Vicerre's shenanigans by now. If she finds [a tennis machine in her backyard](../2021/2021-07-03_elucidation-001_portals.md) or [a crayon labeled "burnt orange" on her desk](2022-10-08_icebreaker-019-020-021-022-023.md), she'd presume Vic placed it there. If she woke up strapped to an operating table, she'd only be wondering what he was plotting instead of scared out of her mind. Considering the time of year, he might even get away with it.
>
> Damn him. If only he wasn't remote still. Solana wishes she could ruffle his hair.

Solana surprising Vicerre:

> [Following the previous day's headlines](2022-10-05_icebreaker-018.md), Solana decides to make a glass of iced tea (the old-fashioned way) as a bonus to Vicerre's lunch. He was always the one who surprised her, so she thought he could use something in return. Out of their current catalog, she went with the strawberry papaya blend and added a drizzle of honey.
>
> Vic seems unusually prompt about portaling away his risotto today—it is still quite warm by the time he gets to it. He ignored the tumbler, though. Solana had to grab the rim of the portal before it closed fully.
>
> "Aren't you forgetting something?" she asks warmly.
>
> "I am?" he replies.
>
> She drags the portal over and above the iced tea. She peeks up through the portal.
>
> Vicerre looks mystified. "...For me," he says.
>
> Solana nods.
>
> He slowly grabs the lip of the tumbler with his fingertips, then pulls it through the portal.
>
> Solana stretches the portal open more, pokes her upper body through, and ruffles Vicerre's hair.
>
> Vicerre still looks mystified.
>
> "Enjoy your lunch."

> How would their reaction change if it was someone they _didn't_ know? ([2022-10-06](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1027432197633880075), moscd)

[hypothetical]

> Solana jumps, but upon realizing it's a lighthearted prank, she laughs and gives credit to the person who got her. Later that evening, she chats with Vicerre about the incident. It made her day and made her realize she'd best prepare for seasonal shenanigans.
>
> Vicerre flinches, then holds the jumper's wrist in a portal and ask who the hell they were. He would be unconvinced he was just being pranked until Solana persuades him to lighten up.
