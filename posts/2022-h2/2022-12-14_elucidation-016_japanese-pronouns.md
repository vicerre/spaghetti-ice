# Elucidation 016 – Japanese Pronouns

## Overview

The Japanese language has several embedded elements that contribute to storytelling. Of note is the language's use of pronouns.

The pronouns characters use to address themselves and others conveys something about their relations with others. For instance, a character can express disdain for someone simply by using a specific variation of the word "you". As another example, a character using a different pronoun than usual can indicate something is very wrong—or, depending on the circumstances, very right.

If my narrative continuity were translated into Japanese, the characters' use of Japanese language pronouns would act as explicit indicators of their personalities. A change in their use of pronouns indicates a change in character.

As of the time of writing, my characters would use the following as their first-person pronouns:

- Alis: The formal _watashi_.
- Solana: The personal, friendly _atashi_.
- Vic: The informal, mild _boku_.
  - Before [2022-10-07](2022-10-16_icebreaker-028-029-030.md), the formal _watashi_.
