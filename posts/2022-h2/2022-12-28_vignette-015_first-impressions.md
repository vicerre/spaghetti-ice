> The classical fashion sense.

> Yep, there was no doubt who he was.

> Solana had been preparing holiday dinner with Vic when the doorbell rang.
>
> Vic pointed in the direction of the entrance door and waved his fingers in a circle. "That's Alice," he said.
>
> He gave Solana a friendly nudge on the shoulder. "You should get the door." [From his tone, Solana guessed Vic wanted her to solve his last puzzle.](2022-12-25_vignette-014_holiday-dinner-prelude.md)
>
> She left the kitchen and opened the door. She wasn't sure what she expected, but she can't say she isn't pleasantly surprised.

---

> Alice greets her with a curt nod of his head. "Afternoon," he says. He glances up and down her profile. "Miss Solana, I take it?"
>
> Solana's mouth hangs open. It was a surreal experience for Solana to meet someone with Vic's past appearance and mannerisms. Once she gets past the initial reaction, though, she finds herself tickled by his presence.
>
> Her open mouth twists into a smile. "Yeah!" she replies. She beckons him indoors. "Come in!" she says, "Can I get you anything to drink? Any specific flavor of tea?"
>
> Alice's expression relaxes, and he graciously nods. "Thank you for the offer, Miss Solana. I don't suppose you have spearmint?"
>
> Solana blinks and looks back inside. Towards the kitchen, she asks Vic, "Do we?"
>
> A moment later, Vic replies, "We do now!"

---

> Once Alice had settled on the couch, Vic comes over and extends a cup of freshly-brewed tea towards him.
>
> Upon seeing Vic, Alice's gaze becomes fixated on something. His gaze continues to hold steady even after accepting the cup of tea.
>
> Vic blinks and tilts his head, then realizes. "Ah, yes," he says, "How do you like the scarf?" He tugs on it. ["It was a holiday gift from Solana."](2022-12-23_vignette-013_holiday-gifts.md)
>
> Alice lifts the teacup to his mouth. He raises his eyebrows and smiles at Vic with a sort of fascinated, disquieting intrigue. "I see Solana has placed you under her thrall."
>
> Vic makes an exaggerated, pretentious pose. "Welcome to your future," he replies. Smirking, he adds, "Truly frightening, isn't it?"
>
> Alice sips the tea and glares at him wryly. "Keep up those pretenses, and I'll scald your tongue."
>
> "Please, Alice, you'd need Solana's help if you want any hope of burning me," Vic replies. He then glances downwards and grimaces. "...Although I suppose it would ruin the scarf."
>
> Alice relaxes, softly chuckles, and lets the topic be.

---

> He then turns to Solana, tilting his head and observing her with a reserved curiosity. "I suppose you must have questions about me," he states.
>
> Solana nods. It was clear Alice and Vic had a history with each other, and that was outside the experiences they had in common.
>
> But first, she had a different, more pertinent question:
>
> "So... is 'Alice' your real name?"
