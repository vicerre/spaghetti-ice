# Rendition 026 – Sunfished-style Render (2022-10-21 – 2022-10-23)

## Overview

I've previously mentioned that [I had an art trade planned with](https://vicerre.tumblr.com/post/672959005928341504/) [Sunfished](https://twitter.com/sunfished) in which we would create art of each other's characters. In the end, this art trade never panned out. Despite this outcome, however, I was still interested in seeing one of my characters (Vicerre) in Sunfished's art style.

Recently, I was inspired to revisit this idea looking at some of Sun's character designs <sup>[1](https://twitter.com/sunfished/status/1573164866738733056), [2](https://twitter.com/sunfished/status/1580088644060127232)</sup>. Sun uses angular, diamond-shaped imagery in his designs. Vicerre is designed with angles and diamond-shaped imagery in mind. With those parallels in mind, I revisited this idea and rendered Vicerre.

## Design notes

- Brush used: Hard Round 8
- I struggled to simultaneously design for and study Sun's style within the same image. This presented an issue when I wanted to render diamond-shaped devices floating around Vicerre, as I didn't have a coherent idea of what they would look like. I took inspiration from [the wheel around Arceus's body](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:HOME493Ice.png) and [Vexen's shield](<https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Frozen_Pride_(358/2_Days)>), but ultimately, I didn't put too much thought into their design.
- Drawing the diamond-shaped devices surrounding Vicerre took more effort than drawing Vicerre himself. As I learned, if you want to render simple, geometric shapes convincingly, you have less room for error than when rendering organic shapes. For that reason, I give my compliments to Sun for his skill in this area.

## Observations

- Sun's art style uses very few concave lines. This runs in contrast to Vicerre's design philosophy, which features heavy use of concave lines. As a result, he looks much cuter in Sunfished's art style than in my native style.
- A surprising amount of Sun's character art (see: Backa, Esper, Ine, Laven, Suna, Sungod) features the character pointing. For that reason, I included this trope when drawing Vicerre.
- A number of Sun's characters have large and/or poofy sleeves in their design (see: 2va, 3va, Esper, Eumia, Macka, Rimi, Sungod). When drawing Vicerre, I exaggerated the design of his jacket to match.
- It is rare for Sun's characters to have visible ears.
- It is common for Sun's characters to have no visible eyebrows.
- It is rare for Sun to use a base color above 70% saturation, except when using the color red (see: Mai).
- Sun often uses angular shading (see: 3va, Esper, Eumia, Ine, Macka, Rimi). This matches one of my art style tropes.
- Sun's characters tend to use bright color palettes. When selecting shades of brown to use in Vicerre's design, I needed to improvise.
- Sun rarely draws lines with sharp, tapered corners, unless the corner joins two lines at a sharp angle.
