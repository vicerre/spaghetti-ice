# Rendition 019 – JRPG-Inspired Design (2022-07-05 – 2022-07-09)

<img src="assets/2022-07-05_image-032.png">

## Overview

One of the hobbies I contribute to in my spare time involves the creation and submission of creature designs. As a part of this hobby, I encounter other people, who often have their own personal character designs.

At the time of writing, it's July. This is the month in which [Art Fight](https://artfight.net/) commences. My friends participate and share art of people's character designs, and, quite naturally, I felt pressure to create a character design to match.

As a result, I drew a character design variant of Vicerre. Not only am I able to apply character design theory to a character which I am intimately familiar with, but the design also acts as _luft_ for any of my friends who wish to draw something more interesting than Vicerre's native design.

Now, Vicerre's native design is not a character design in the traditional sense. Rather, his design is meant as a vehicle for the narratives I compose. It is meant to be convenient to redraw in a sequence, and it belongs in the context of a larger composition. This is in contrast to many people's designs, which are meant to be art pieces in of themselves. Thus, when creating a character design variant of Vicerre, there are conceptual discriminants I must employ.

Back in 2021, I've entertained the idea of ([a character design variant of Vicerre](../2021/2021-11-26_rendition-010_anime.md)). In that post, I took Vicerre's personality and motifs and rendered them through an anime-style lens. While mostly conceptual, the idea provides an excellent basis upon which I could iterate and elaborate. This can be seen reflected in this design, which builds on top of this concept.

## Design notes

- Vicerre's native design makes some simplifying assumptions that allows me to draw him more easily; his design is symmetrical, and his silhouette is well-defined from any camera angle (using a [Cheated Angle](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatedAngle) to achieve this effect). In creating the design presented, I relished in the opportunity to make him inconvenient to draw; his waistcoat and longcoat are both asymmetrical, and his hairstyle requires effort to draw from most angles. Of course, this part bit me when I ended up drawing supporting sketches for him, but, jointly, it was an opportunity to hone my art skills.
- Considering his scientific background in both story continuities, I had to draw him in a classic [Labcoat of Science and Medicine](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LabcoatOfScienceAndMedicine). While overplayed to the point of cliché, the motif works well on him:
  - The length of a longcoat creates a larger, more imposing silhouette on its wearer, which befits Vicerre's imposing nature.
  - He takes inspirations from [Light Is Not Good](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood) and related tropes, being a [Well-Intentioned Extremist](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist) who seeks to save everyone from suffering.
- Considering that his concept was originally inspired by _Kingdom Hearts_ and _Pokémon_, his character design seems incontrovertibly tied to the JRPG genre of video games. Not only did I revisit character designs from these two franchises, but I also referenced character designs from _Danganronpa_, _Genshin Impact_ (technically not a JRPG), and _Persona 5_. As a consequence, the design:
  - Has both fantasy and sci-fi motifs.
  - Is on the "shinier" side of the [Sliding Scale of Shiny Versus Gritty](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfShinyVersusGritty).
  - Operates on somewhat on [Rule of Cool](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool).
- Vicerre uses sharp angles in his character design. If you look at his native character design, his facial contours are wedge-shaped, his body uses triangular forms, and he has a diamond motif in his design. In adapting Vicerre's character to a character design, I retained this motif. In particular:
  - His longcoat uses sharp diamond- and triangular-shaped patterns.
  - His glasses are trapezoidal and lean into the [Stoic Spectacles](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoicSpectacles) trope.
  - The chains on his coat pockets are drawn as diamonds.
  - However, in contrast to his native design, his face shape is less sharp and more traditionally bishonen.
- As Vicerre can be quite conceited, I wanted to reflect this personality trait in my rendering. Compared to his native design, I drew him with design elements that are traditionally seen as classier. In particular, I borrowed design elements commonly seen in aristocratic vampire designs:
  - His hair is well-kempt and suave.
  - He wears a waistcoat and ascot.
  - His shirt is frilled.
  - His longcoat has a high collar.
  - His longcoat has fancy embellishments.
  - He wears white gloves (also inspired by Gendo Ikari from _Neon Genesis Evangelion_).
  - His color palette uses colors associated with power, such as noble blue, gold, and purple.
- I made a few allusions to [his Alolan Ninetales incarnation](../2021/2021-07-03_elucidation-001_portals.md):
  - The bangs hanging in front of his head are an oblique reference to animal ears.
  - The ponytail doubles as a reference to a kitsune tail. I had considered changing the ponytail into twintails to hint at multiple tails, but, considering how this trope is traditionally associated with female characters, I opted against the idea.
- Miscellaneous:
  - Depending on when in each story Vicerre is, he either has [Supernatural Gold Eyes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalGoldEyes) or [Icy Blue Eyes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IcyBlueEyes). My original was to draw him with icy, blue eyes, as they strike a good color balance. Ultimately, however, they came across more as [Innocent Blue Eyes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBlueEyes). Thus, I switched the eye color on this design to gold.
  - Vicerre's longcoat has three sets of belts across the waist. With most real, practical coats, you might have one or two. Three, however, is quite uncommon. This aspect was inspired by straitjackets and skeletal motifs, which are a touch macabre.
  - As I've discovered, footwear design is a weak spot of mine. I don't have many inspirations in mind for footwear in general, let alone JRPG magitech footwear. I suppose the logical conclusion, then, is for me to observe more characters' feet.
  - The branch of neuroscience has few tropes associated with it. Giri and neurons are icons that can be used as motifs, but these elements were too organic compared to this design's angular aesthetic. In my love of fractals, I considered abstracting giri into a [Hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) pattern. However, I found the pattern to be too blocky and unrecognizable, so I abandoned the concept.

## Miscellaneous notes

- I spent more time on this concept than expected, but this was still fun to draw!
- This design can be iterated upon further. In particular, I see places for improvement on the cuffs, boots, and overall level of detail. However, instead of investing more time into this particular iteration, I think it is a better use of my time to come back to this idea in the future, where I feel more actively compelled to evolve upon it.
