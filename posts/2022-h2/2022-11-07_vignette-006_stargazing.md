# Vignette 006 – Stargazing

> "How do you like the stars tonight?"
>
> A few kilometers away from the city, Vic and Solana were sitting on the steps outside an observatory.
>
> Solana never saw stars like these back in the city; the street lights would always flood them out. Out here, though, these stars formed a grand cosmic tapestry against the infinite, dark canvas of space.
>
> Yet, it wasn't as though she never saw unfiltered night sky. If that was all Vic wanted to show, he could have activated the interdimensional portal and taken them somewhere remote. Instead, they went to a place just outside the city. They didn't use portals, either. Instead, they traveled by rail, then walked the rest of the way.
>
> Something was different about Vic this evening.

> Solana's eyes were fixed upwards.
>
> "They're beautiful," she says.
>
> "Aren't they?" Vic replies. "It's been far too long since I've seen them at this magnitude."
>
> "You got inspired to see them all of a sudden?"
>
> Vic looks at Solana with a light smile, his gaze fidgeting. ["Something like that."](2022-11-05_vignette-004_enthralled.md)
>
> Solana thinks for a moment. She turns her attention towards the long streak of stars stretching from horizon to zenith, then traces a line around it with her finger. "Let's see here... to start, that's our galaxy, right?"
>
> Vicerre nods. "We're in the Orion Arm, roughly halfway between the galaxy's center and edge."
>
> "Is that why it stretches all the way across the sky?"
>
> Vic starts, but he holds his breath. A moment later, he says, "Solana, you don't need to entertain my whims this evening."
>
> "Oh." She sees what's happening.
>
> "I'm speaking with Armin, aren't I?"
>
> Vic nods. "Sometimes he just wants to spend time with you, without any shenanigans or supernatural happenings."

---

> "So... do you still want to talk about the stars?"
>
> "Do you? You're free to lead the conversation, you know."
>
> Solana shuffles towards Vic and leans against him. "Maybe I just like seeing you gush about the things you enjoy."
>
> She teases one lock of hair. "And, uh, I guess I don't know what I'd say otherwise."
>
> "Fair enough," he replies. "In that case..." He extends a finger next to Solana's right eye.
>
> "Do you recognize the three stars over there?"
>
> "That's Orion's belt, right?"
>
> "Yes. If you look just below, you may see the Orion Nebula hanging just off it. If you trace the stars to the right, you'll see Aldebaran—that's the bright, red star—and past that, the Pleiades. They're not so much a single star as they are a cluster—and they're quite a sight if you can see them all clearly."
>
> As he points, Solana's gaze follows, stopping to admire each sight.
>
> "Oh, wow. I didn't know any of that," she says. "You know your night sky."

---

> She then squints. "...You know, a portal in the sky would be nice right now, so we can get a clearer look."
>
> Vic blinks, then makes a confused face.
>
> Solana stares at him with anticipation.
>
> He lightly grimaces.
>
> She looks at the observatory. "...There's probably a public telescope inside."
>
> Vic's expression relaxes, and he mulls over that suggestion.
>
> "Probably," he replies.
>
> The two of them stare at each other.
>
> "So..." Solana says, "do _you_ know how to use a telescope?"
>
> Vic shakes his head. "...It should work like a microscope in reverse, shouldn't it?"
>
> Solana looks down, and her lips scrunch. "I'd think so, yeah."
>
> Vic looks at the observatory, then shrugs.
>
> "...We'll figure it out."
