# Vignette 009 â€“ Holiday Lights

> Solana calls Vic.
>
> Initially, she planned to invite Vic over to hang up holiday lights around the house together. When she checked, though, the old holiday lights she had were busted. Instead, she invites Vic to go to the hardware store to buy another set.
>
> The two of them pick a string of lights that are small, circular, and bluish-white. [If Solana had to guess, Vic chose those lights because they reminded him of the night sky when they went to the observatory.](2022-11-07_vignette-006_stargazing.md)
>
> After they return to Solana's place, Vic asks Solana if she had a spare ladder.
>
> [Solana asks Vic if he was still averse to using his portals.](2022-11-07_vignette-006_stargazing.md)
>
> Vic says he wasn't planning on using his portals, as they would interfere with the experience.
>
> Solana thinks, then assures Vic she doesn't mind. She'd rather Vic be comfortable with himself. She considers Vic's portals a part of the experience, and he should, too.
>
> Vic still feels self-conscious about his use of portals. Still, he opens one portal, if only for the express purpose of poking Solana's nose. [Solana turns and sneezes,](2022-11-11_icebreaker-041-042-043.md) then blushes.
>
> Vic smiles, then gets to work. Solana follows him.
