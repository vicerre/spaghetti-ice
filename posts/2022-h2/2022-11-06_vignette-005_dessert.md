# Vignette 005 – Dessert

---

> [Outside Oneiros, Vic offers Alis the gelatin dessert he made for Pod.](...) Since she is currently unavailable, he doesn't want to waste the dessert. Alis is intrigued, if skeptical.
>
> Vic then suggests sending Monaghan a part of the dish, which grabs Alis's attention.
>
> In short notice, the three of them find and sit at a table in the park. While they're eating, Monaghan catches up with Alis and Vic about their current Oneiros project.

---

> Monaghan asks why Solana isn't 'in the know' about Oneiros. Considering what Alis would do for her, it seems like a glaring omission. Alis nods to that.
>
> Vic explains it was Solana's idea; for the sake of the other participants, she wanted the experience to be as authentic as possible. Considering her prior knowledge, though, she'll likely deduce that it's some sort of puzzle before too long.
>
> Vic mulls over how risky it is to treat Solana's memories as something to be manipulated. [Ever since he was on the receiving end of a memory wipe,](../2021/2021-07-26_elucidation-004_character-personality.md) he considered his memories all the more precious. There was a reason he avoided using that part of his skillset since then.

> His thoughts are interrupted when Monaghan compliments him on the dessert and asks for the recipe.
>
> He isn't sure whether Monaghan intended to snap him out of one of his musings, but he obliges. Eventually, he explains that the dessert is made from insect larvae.
>
> Monaghan looks quizzically at Alis, as if asking what that implies about him by extension.
>
> Alis simply lets Monaghan draw her own conclusions.

## Bonus passage

> Vic tells Alis that he would like to spend more time with him—you know, barring any potential spatial paradoxes. He sees something of himself in Alis, and he thinks it would benefit Alis if he tried something similar. You see, he was a bit standoffish before, and it was only when—
>
> He stops. He realizes he was about to espouse Solana's virtues for how he has changed. Coming to that conclusion, he feels the need to thank her. Something keenly unfamiliar tickles the cockles of his heart.
>
> He excuses himself, thanks Alis for the conversation, and promptly leaves.
