# Vignette 010 â€“ Ice Skating

> Solana and Vic travel to the public skating rink in New Quendon. Solana made a reservation earlier this week, and she thought the rink would be a fun place to try a new seasonal activity. She was interested in checking out the holiday decorations in the area, anyway.
>
> Solana quickly figures how to balance herself and skate. Ten minutes in, she is able to glide to the center of the rink.
>
> Solana wondered if Vic's control over ice would help him ice skate. He was more tolerant of low temperatures than the average person, so it didn't seem like a stretch for him to have additional ice-related abilities. Vic's lack of elegance upon hitting the ice, though, quickly disproves that theory.
>
> For a while, he stays by the edge of the rink. Solana could tell he was making an active effort not to 'cheat'. Soon, however, he's able to travel towards the center, relying on Solana for support. Fifteen minutes later, he's able to join her freely.
>
> In the following twenty minutes, the two of them practice additional techniques. Solana learns about crossovers, and the two of them try gliding on one leg each.
>
> As they do so, they behold the holiday decorations surrounding the rink. Solana hasn't seen the giant Christmas tree centerpiece before, and she marvels at how decorated it is.
>
> Ultimately, while neither of them become particularly adept at ice skating, they have a fun time.
