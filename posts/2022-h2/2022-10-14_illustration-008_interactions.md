# Illustration 008 – Interactions (2022-09-19 – 2022-10-01)

<img src="assets/2022-10-14_image-042.png">

## Overview

I mentioned in [this post](2022-09-22_rendition-023_design.md) how I wanted to draw light sketches of Vicerre, in contrast to the primary image in the post. Here, I've compiled said sketches.

## Design notes

- The leftmost pair of images is inspired by [shirotaniart's](https://www.tumblr.com/shirotaniart) [take](https://twitter.com/ShirotaniArt/status/1521941745180807182) on the [Watcha Got There?](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/whatcha-got-there) meme.
- The leftmost pair of images features [moscd's](https://moscd.tumblr.com/) [Schnoztrich](https://www.smogon.com/forums/posts/9218793) (used with permission) in place of the ostrich in the original meme.
- The bottom-right image is inspired by [Icebreaker 010](2022-09-29_icebreaker-010.md).
