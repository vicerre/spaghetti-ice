# Rendition 020 – Vicerre Icon (2022-07-24)

<img src="assets/2022-07-24_image-033.png">

## Overview

I've wanted to update my Discord profile icon for a while. I've used my previous one for just under a year, and while serviceable, the icon often received more questions and remarks unrelated to its intent than not. Thus, I sought to find a replacement profile icon.

Simultaneously, I have friends who I either 1. have an active art trade with, or 2. have an active commission out with. Originally, I had aimed to repurpose one of their images as my next Discord icon. However, given a set of circumstances that happened on Sunday, I opted to create an icon myself:

1. I was reminded of this subject from a happenstance discussion on Discord avatars.
2. I had spare time that day.
3. I still wanted to experiment with the new Huion tablet.

Thus, I spent some time to work out a new Discord icon.

## Design notes

I have drawn icons of Vicerre before <sup>[1](../2021/2021-07-01_rendition-003_profile-icon.md), [2](2022-07-05_rendition-018_icon.md)</sup>. While suitable for the tone of this blog, these icons did not carry a tone appropriate for a Discord environment. With that consideration in mind, I drew a more optimistic profile of Vicerre. Compared to the previous icons, his head is held higher, and the lighting is warmer.

However, I would be amiss to not reference Vicerre's darker nature. I included two aspects of this in the icon: 1. The blue backlight, and 2. the concentric rings in the background, harkening his otherwise-missing [Supernatural Gold Eyes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalGoldEyes).

Overall, I think this icon strikes the right balance of expressive and expository, even if it's not the most elaborate.

## Observations

- Since I've upgraded my tablet, I've been able to work at a faster pace. Considering this, this icon is the closest image to date where I can say that the art style resembles the one I use in traditional media, for quick drawings.
- [I had previously mentioned](2022-07-05_rendition-018_icon.md) I struggled to color in drawings that start with lineart rather than with color. Surprisingly, I did not experience this event when coloring in this icon. Instead, I'm titillated that this icon rendered well, despite it starting out as lineart.
- During the course of this drawing, I discovered that Photoshop, by default, does not offer striped gradients through its gradient tool. As I desired to create concentric rings as a background pattern, I had to define a striped gradient manually. While frustrating, this experience gave me the opportunity to learn how to create custom gradients.
  - I later learned about [an alternate way of generating concentric circles](https://photoshophelp.blogs.com/photoshophelp/2005/02/concentric_circ.html). While this method has limited flexibility, I thought it would be worth mentioning—if only to clarify—that a built-in method does exist.
- In practice, I have been finding it strange to use Vicerre as the subject for my Discord icon. I've always considered icons to represent the self, yet this character is more of an alter ego, persona, or shadow archetype, rather than the true self. Using his image as my own carries some psychological implications, I suppose.
