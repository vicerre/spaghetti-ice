# Vignette 012 â€“ Endpoint

[non-canon]

> Solana sits cross-legged in a chair in Vic's lab.
>
> She had been in Vic's lab many times before, but this was the first time she had seen this particular chair. It was modern-looking and geometric. In contrast, the chairs she had seen in Vic's lab were more functional in design.
>
> The interdimensional portal had been active. Did the other Vic wheel it in?
>
> Meanwhile, Vic was in a discussion with the other Vic, who was seated at his workstation. Both of their eyes were clear blue.
>
> One of the screens at the workstation displays a line chart. The line remained flat for an extended period, before slowly dropping in value. The y-axis is labeled `spacetime_integrity`.
>
> From the side of the lab, Solana hears a clicking sound. The water in the tea kettle was ready for brewing.
>
> Vic looks over from the workstation. To the other Vic, he says, "One moment."

> Vic offers Solana a cup of [chamomile](2022-11-24_vignette-008_synthesis.md). He then steps back and paces, a troubled expression on his face.
>
> It takes him considerable deliberation before he finds any words.
>
> "Solana."
>
> Solana clasps the teacup and looks sternly. "What's up?"
>
> "...You were created from this universe's fragments," Vic states.
>
> He glances back at his workstation. "And... well, you can see the data says. The integrity of this universe has been faltering recently."
>
> "What does that mean?" she promptly replies.
>
> "It means this universe is on a course towards complete dissolution," the other Vic interjects. "And along with that, you."
>
> Vic stares at Solana's feet, silent.

---

> Solana purses her lips and stares at him. After a long pause, she speaks up. "...Do we have a solution?"
>
> Vic looks at her with a grave expression.
>
> The other Vic says, "I did state this was a matter of your own existence, Miss Solana."
>
> Solana takes a long breath.
>
> The other Vic looks over at his counterpart. "We have reason to believe the universe will return to stability should you relinquish your existence within the following days."
>
> "However..." he adds, "we recognize this may not be the most appealing option for you. Should you wish to preserve your identity, we have the option to forsake this universe. In this event, my universe is open as asylum."
>
> "...That's not to say that this is a complete solution by any means," Vic comments. "There's no guarantee we won't encounter a spatial paradox or five along the way."
>
> Solana responds with a rigid nod of her head. She then sinks into her chair and takes a deep sip of tea.
>
> [Just a bit ago, she was enjoying an evening of ice skating with Vic.](2022-12-04_vignette-010_ice-skating.md) Now, they were talking about the fate of herself and everyone she cared about. Even if she was used to surprises like this, she still thought this news was sudden.
>
> "...Hey. Vics," she says. "...Can we talk about this?"

## Option 1 (Pro-Sacrifice)

Outcome:

> The universe stabilizes, and Vic loses Solana.
>
> Solana starts appearing in Vic's dreams. Vic starts monitoring the spacetime chart every day in hopes that something spikes.

## Option 2 (Anti-Sacrifice)

Outcome:

> The universe continues to destabilize, and the cast evacuates to Alis' universe.
>
> After their original universe disintegrates completely, Vic starts disintegrating as well. He states that they have triggered a spatial paradox, as there are now two of him in only one universe. Alis offers to let Vic be the variant that lives, but Vic rejects that offer.
>
> Before he fades away completely, he gives a parting farewell to Solana, thanking her for being a dear friend and companion. [He also offers Alis his mantle for a third time,](2022-11-14_vignette-007_invitation.md) and this time, Alis accepts. Vic states he looks forward to Alis's future.
>
> A few days later, an ice kitsune appears at Alis's doorstep.
