# Meta 007 – Naming Conventions

[Arc 2]

## Overview

When I summarized the role play events in which Vicerre was created, I retroactively titled the narrative _Spaghetti Ice_. Then, when I adapted these same events into literature, I titled the narrative _Shaved Ice_.

Since I began writing answers to character prompts (which I otherwise refer to as "icebreakers"), I've noticed that these pieces of writing create a third, distinct narrative—one with a fun and casual tone. I felt the need to define these narratives as a set of stories separate from my previous narratives.

Thus, everything past **2022-09-19** (starting from [Icebreaker 001](2022-09-24_icebreaker-001-002-003-004.md)) should be considered part of this narrative thread.

After some consideration, I decided on the title _Cherry Ice_.

## Explanation (2024-02-07)

- The words "cherry ice" match _Spaghetti Ice_ and _Shaved Ice_ in pattern.
- The words "cherry ice" follow the [Edible Theme Naming](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdibleThemeNaming) convention of my previous titles. These words preserve the following naming elements: cold, dessert, metaphorical, sweet.
- The words "cherry ice" do not form a standard English construct, thus evoking intrigue.
- The word "cherry" refers to a sweet red fruit, alluding to the role of Solana in the story.
- The word "ice" refers to the role of Vicerre in the story.

- The word "solstice" matches _Spaghetti Ice_ and _Shaved Ice_ in lexical structure.
- The word "solstice" is fairly uncommon in everyday English, thus evoking intrigue.
- The word "solstice" includes both "sol" and "ice", alluding to the sun-themed Solana and the ice-themed Vicerre.
- The word "solstice" evokes a turning point, playing into this work's narrative.

## Explanation (2023-07-08)

- The adjective "sublime" pairs well with the slice of life genre of this narrative.
- The concept of sublimation mirrors Vicerre's [Defrosting Ice King](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen) characterization.
- The word "sublime" is related to the word "subliminal", which pairs well with cognition and science in this narrative.
- The word "sublime" matches _Spaghetti Ice_ and _Shaved Ice_ in lexical structure.

## Explanation (2022-10-15)

- In keeping with the [Edible Theme Naming](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdibleThemeNaming) of my previous titles, I wanted to keep as many of the following naming elements as possible: cold, dessert, metaphorical, sweet
- Considering that this narrative falls into the "slice of life" genre, I wanted to allude to the genre by titling the narrative after food that can be sliced. Cake, being a sweet dessert, seemed to be the most appropriate match.
- After some time, I came across the Wikipedia article on [fondant icing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fondant_icing). I discovered that the word "fondant" derives from the French word meaning "melting". This etymology mirrors Vicerre's [Defrosting Ice King](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen) characterization.
- As a bonus, the word "fondant" starts with the syllable "fond"—as in, Vicerre's growing fondness for other characters.
