# Vignette 007 â€“ Invitation

> "Al-is..." Vic says, his tone rising.
>
> Vic opened the interdimensional portal in Alis's living room-slash-workspace.
>
> Alis looks over his chair at Vic with a disappointed expression.
>
> "You're quite the devious one, aren't you?" Vic says. ["Overriding me through Oneiros, causing me to have an epiphany about myself..."](2022-11-05_vignette-004_enthralled.md)
>
> Vic sighs. "...Finding myself perfectly content to let you be the superior of us two."
>
> He holds out a hard drive towards Alis. "Here," he says. "I grant you full access to my designs. This drive contains all the files and associated notes. This includes [my collection of rare and exotic DNA sequences](...), [Arclight](../2022-h1/2022-01-25_elucidation-012_arclight.md), [schematics for the Dream Machine](../2021/2021-11-25_illustration-003_dream-machine.md), and other projects I've discussed."
>
> Alis's eyes widen for a fleeting moment. Then, he relaxes and stares at Vic with a skeptical, quizzical expression.
>
> Vic glances away. "I know. [You didn't accept the offer last time, either.](2022-07-29_vignette-002_interdimensional.md) But I really do trust you, Alis, which is why I think you should have it."
>
> An awful feeling suddenly washes over Vic. It was as though locusts and spiders were swarming inside his skull. He finds himself compelled to stow the hard drive away in his jacket pocket, before returning through the portal from which he entered.
>
> He wishes he could say he hated that feeling.
>
> After Vic is released from Alis's grasp, he immediately pokes his head back through the portal.
>
> "You know, Alis," he says, ignoring Alis flinching, "I'm still inviting you to the holiday dinner."
