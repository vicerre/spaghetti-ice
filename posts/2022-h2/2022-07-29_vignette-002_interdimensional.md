# Vignette 002 – Interdimensional

> Vicerre looked up from his laptop. "Stay in _your_ universe?"
>
> His doppelgänger sat across the table from him. He rested his fork on the cavatappi.
>
> He cleared his throat. "You _did_ say you came to this universe through a gateway of your own design, correct?"
>
> Vicerre nodded.
>
> The other Vicerre said, "...That's a _very_ impressive feat in my universe, you know."
>
> "Thank you," he replied.
>
> The other Vicerre said, "Given how confident you are in crossing into this dimension, surely, the mechanics and underlying principles of interdimensional travel must generalize? So..." He waved his hands frivolously. "Why not share them with your analog?"
>
> Vicerre glanced at him, then back to the monitor.
>
> The other Vicerre stared at him for a while.
>
> Vicerre blinked at him.
>
> Then, he said, "Well… it's not that I don't _trust_ you; according to my readings, you seem to be on a similar mental wavelength as me."
>
> He folded the laptop lid down and held his hands on top. He contemplated, then sighed sharply.
>
> "The fact that you are my analog is precisely the problem," he said. "I can't _stand_ knowing that I'll be sharing this domain with someone who rivals me—even if that person is myself."
>
> He tossed a coy scoff at the other Vicerre. "That would put my authority on interdimensional travel at risk, you know."
>
> The other Vicerre looked at him mildly. "...You're not willing to lose that authority, are you?"
>
> Vicerre glanced away. "No, I suppose I'm not."
>
> The other Vicerre turned his head askew, then smiled. "Yet, you willingly traveled to an alternate universe, knowing that there is someone on the other side who shares the same ambitions and goals as you had."
>
> Vicerre smirked. "Yes. Yes, I had. I trust that you won't, say, 'coerce' me to join the collective _you've_ been assembling?" He looked at the other Vicerre and blinked. "…We _are_ past that point in this timeline, I take it?"
>
> The other Vicerre looked at him with droll amusement.
>
> Vicerre sighed under his breath. "Why did I expect any other response? Damn you, me."
>
> He frowned. "Either we're before that point on the timeline—in which case, my readings are mistaken—unlikely—or you're ahead of where _I_ am on the timeline, in which case you outmatch me. Or… how's this for a third option? This is all a front, and you're leading on this conversation for your own entertainment."
>
> With that, the other Vicerre shrugged. "I have no reason to believe your readings are incorrect, either."
>
> "You see, if I trust that, then I should know that—"
>
> Vicerre paused. He flitted his eyes at the other Vicerre, who stared intently in response.
>
> He continued, "—You're not really looking for knowledge on how interdimensional travel works, and instead, you're content to just enjoy spending time with your analog."
>
> The other Vicerre nodded keenly.
>
> Vicerre half-chuckled. "...And, by giving me the choice, I'll be compelled to give you the information, anyway."
>
> He interleaved his fingers and rested his nose on top of them, averting his gaze from the other Vicerre. "I've been outplayed."
>
> A moment of silence later, he glanced back at the other Vicerre. "...Surprisingly, this isn't as bitter a defeat as I expected. And not just because it's _you_, either. More so that… I'm in the company of someone I know all too well, and I trust that he won't take advantage of the opportunity. A friend, even, if you could call one's analog one?"
>
> Then, he smiled defeatedly. "All right, I'll explain it all," he said. "But first—"
>
> One portal opened in front of the other Vicerre, followed by a steaming cup of tea.
>
> The other Vicerre curtly looked at the cup. "Hmm."
>
> One portal opened in front of Vicerre, followed by a steaming cup of tea.
>
> Without hesitation, Vicerre grabbed the cup in front of him, swirled it around, chilled it, and took a sip. The other Vicerre did the same.
>
> "Spearmint," he commented. "Nostalgic."
>
> Looking up from his tea, the other Vicerre furrowed his brow. "Strawberry…?"
>
> "...It's a long story."
