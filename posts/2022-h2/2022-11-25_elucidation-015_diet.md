# Elucidation 015 â€“ Vicerre's Diet

## Overview

The topic of food often comes up in character prompts. Most, if not all, characters have a diet, so food acts as a common ground for others to gain insight into that character's lifestyle. Additionally, as Vic has a history with certain classes of foods, I find the topic interesting to write about on its own.

There are two key aspects of Vic's diet:

- Vic follows the Mediterranean diet. Given his knowledge of biology, he cares about his health.
- Vic enjoys sweets. Ever since the Gamemaster instilled a penchant for strawberries in him, Vic has developed a fondness of sweet foods.

<!-- This came to me as a surprise, as I can't pin this trait on any particular inspiration. -->
