> Solana looked over at the log, then grinned. "You're such a narcissist."
>
> "_Narcissist?_" Vicerre exclaimed. He held his expression, slack-jawed, in intrigue.
>
> "I mean," Solana said, "you finish testing your interdimensional portal, and the first thing you do is visit a copy of yourself."
>
> Vicerre rolled his eyes. "Solana, that is _entirely_ inaccurate," he said. "The word 'copy' implies an equivalence relation between the two—you could substitute me with my copy without affecting the timeline of events."
>
> He pointed to the monitor. "As you can see, the character I met is _quite_ divergent—his livelihood and genetics, to start—not to mention his preference in tea. We could not take each others' place so easily. Rather, he is as closely related to me as you are."
>
> "Well, if you say so," Solana replied.
>
> She then thought for a moment, then stifled a laugh. "...Does that make it fair game to ship you two together?"
>
> "_NO._"
