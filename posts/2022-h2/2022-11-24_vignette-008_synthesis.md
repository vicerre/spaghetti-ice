# Vignette 008 – Synthesis

> Alis knocks on the metal frame of the portal.
>
> "Come in," Armin says, sitting calmly in his chair.
>
> Alis enters the portal and into Armin's lab, scanning the area. He had seen the lab before through the veil, but this was his first time observing it from Armin's side.
>
> He first notes the similarities—the stark, fluorescent lights, the stale scent of disinfectant, and the subtle humming of machinery. He then notes the differences—the haphazard space management, the coat rack next to the portal gate... and a glass lamp on Armin's desk, filled with something not unlike starlight. Alis couldn't help but tilt his head askew.
>
> He then turns his attention to the rest of Armin's desk. A collection of teas lay atop it, offering a diverse selection of flavors. Among the selection were spearmint, oolong, and chamomile, as well as seven distinct herbal tea blends. Furthermore, all the teas were loose-leaf. Alis finds Armin's taste in tea up to par.
>
> Armin waves to him, then taps the hard drive on his desk. ["You didn't change your mind about the offer, did you?" he asks.](2022-11-14_vignette-007_invitation.md)
>
> Alis shakes his head, then says, "I have not. Rather, I've come here for a different reason."
>
> "Oh?" Armin says. From his chair, he turns around, curious.

> Armin didn't seem fettered when Alis informed him he would be using Oneiros. Instead, he reacted with the same amount of discretion as if Alis had announced they would be taking a school trip.
>
> Alis's pride is wounded, but he keeps face.
>
> Upon reaching his Headscape, Alis finds himself perturbed; there were several discrepancies he had not anticipated.
>
> The first was the flooding. The area was always snowy, but even if the snow completely melted, it couldn't have produced as much standing water as was present—much less a layer up to his ankles.
>
> The second was the landscape. The last time he was in the inner chamber, it contained a small park with rolling hills. Now, those hills had been flattened.
>
> The third was the architecture. The inner chamber was surrounded on all sides by a wide, dark, steel wall. This wall had been simple and stark, but now, it was embellished with pilasters and spires.
>
> Alis's eyes dart along the ground, looking for something to fixate on.
>
> "This is unusual," he murmurs. "My Headscape has changed. It's as though it had been..."
>
> "Hybridized?" Armin remarks, a few meters away.
>
> Alis's eyes dart towards him. He begins to open his mouth in response, but he then glances away.
>
> He had seen combined Headscapes before. The last time he observed the combination of two similar Headscapes, the combined product lacked significant differences. The last time he observed two disjoint Headscapes, the combined product was haphazard and amalgamated.
>
> In contrast to either, the changes here produced a consistent, cohesive, even pristine result.
>
> With this observation in mind, he draws a long breath, then simply responds, "Hmm."

> "Armin," Alis says.
>
> Armin looks at him gently. "What is it?"
>
> "Do you know why I brought you into Oneiros?"
>
> Armin presses his fingers against his chin, then replies, "...You wanted to show me something you couldn't say."
>
> Alis nods. "Correct. However, as my Headscape has been compromised..."
>
> "...You can't be sure we won't uncover things that should stay hidden."
>
> Alis nods again.

---

> It starts raining.
>
> Alis folds his arms behind his back, and his eyes meander. "My motivation for Oneiros—a world without suffering—was due to him."
>
> Armin lingers on Alis's words. Whereas he was wide-eyed a moment ago, his gaze was now dim.
>
> Alis adds, "He wasn't a human, either. Instead, he was..." then looks towards Armin expectantly.
>
> No more than a second later, Armin replies, "Was he a kitsune as well?"
>
> Alis nods. "That's correct." His shoulders sink, and his face contorts. "How do you suppose I lost him?"
>
> "...Experimentation by your own hands," Armin reluctantly replies.
>
> "And as a result..."
>
> "You isolated yourself and drove yourself deeper into your work to amend your mistake."
>
> "Until...?"
>
> "Clementine got you out."
>
> Alis's gaze lingers on Armin, then simply mutters, "Hmm."

---

> Alis starts pacing around Armin, each step measured and inching closer. "It was then I accepted his death and I relinquished my use of Oneiros."
>
> He stops in front of Armin, glancing aside. "Yet, after all this, you suddenly appear, hailing from some alternate dimension."
>
> Upon hearing the word 'yet', Armin's expression falters.
>
> A weary smile spreads across Alis's face.
>
> Alis stares at Armin, then says, "Armin Vicerre—you share my family name and appearance, yet you also share his given name and personality. Not only do you act as my analog, but you also act as his."
>
> With a calm yet firm tone, he adds, "You travel here, flaunt your projects, then invite me to a blasted holiday dinner, as though we've been friends all this time. ...It's as if your very existence undermines my past."
>
> He breaks his gaze, and his tone becomes quiet. "...Excuse me if I come across as reserved when we talk, Armin. Considering these circumstances, I don't know what to make of you."
>
> Armin stares back at him. He doesn't say anything immediately.
>
> The rain continues to fall.

> "I recognize I can be unconventional, Alistair," Armin finally replies. "I'm truly sorry if I've caused you any trouble. If you prefer, I can rescind the invitation and—"
>
> Alis turns to Armin, raising his hand. "No, no, that's all right," he replies. "Your existence is nothing you should apologize for. I just..."
>
> He has a conflicted expression. He pauses, then adds, "I'll be fine. I just need time. You know that already."
>
> Armin's cheek scrunches. "It doesn't mean I can't care about you regardless."
>
> Alis jerks, then sharply exhales and grumbles to himself. Why did Armin have to make it so hard?
>
> "Alis?" Armin says.
>
> Alis looks up.
>
> "...Once we return to the Physical Plane, would you like any tea?" Armin asks. ["Solana got me this oolong precisely two months ago,](2022-09-26_icebreaker-006.md) and I've been meaning to dispatch it. So far, it's paired well with hibiscus, and... well, I think it would pair well with spearmint, too."
>
> Alis becomes silent. [Why did it have to be that flavor of tea?](2022-07-29_vignette-002_interdimensional.md)
>
> The rain eases.
>
> He takes a slow, measured breath.
>
> "...Hmm."
