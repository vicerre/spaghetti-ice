# Rendition 028 – Pokémon Art Style Study (2022-11-13 – 2022-11-19, 2022-11-26 – 2022-11-27)

## Overview

Previously, I've drawn Vicerre in [Sunfished's art style](2022-10-25_rendition-026_art-style.md), and in doing so, studied another artist's workflow. As I learned much about my own workflow through this exercise, I sought to repeat this exercise using another artist's style.

Separately, I had browsed TV Tropes. On TV Tropes, I encountered the word "wisteria", a species of tree. I noticed how the phonemes in the word remind me of the phonemes in "Vicerre".

These two factors inspired me.

In _Pokémon_, professor characters are traditionally named after species of trees (Oak, Elm, Birch, etc.). If Vicerre were to translate into the _Pokémon_ universe, he would adapt well using the alias "Professor Wisteria". Thus, I drew Vicerre in the _Pokémon_ art style.

## Design notes

- When drawing a character in a different style, the artist must employ two skills: rendering and designing. Both of these skills are required to make a convincing character design. In drawing Vicerre in the _Pokémon_ art style, I had to consider both factors:
  - Due to a lack of second- and third-level design elements, Vicerre's base design did not mesh with _Pokémon's_ design philosophy. Due to this, I embellished his design with details not seen in his original design.
- The _Pokémon_ art style is deceptively challenging to replicate. The simpler an art style is, the less margin of error you have in making it look accurate:
  - In my native style, I often convert my sketch layer directly into my lineart layer. With this exercise, I instead drew four sketch layers before drawing lineart layers on top. I found this change of workflow to be productive, as I found little need to revise my lineart layers afterward.
- In adapting Vicerre's hairstyle to the _Pokémon_ art style, I drew inspiration from [his previous JRPG adaptation](2022-07-11_rendition-019_jrpg.md).

## Observations

- In contrast to my native art style, characters drawn in the _Pokémon_ art style have larger foreheads and longer legs.
- The final render required 54 layers and 25 groups. This is by far the most number of layers/groups dedicated to a character image to date.
