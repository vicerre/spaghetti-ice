# Icebreaker 044

> Your characters find an extra $50 in their wallet. What do they do with it? ([2022-11-11](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1040639326058455080), [source](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/448538687983321100/1039984905540616263))

[hypothetical]

Solana:

> - If the money is a $50 bill: Solana reacts with surprise. The banks don't usually dispense $50 bills, so she doesn't expect one in her wallet. She asks Vic if he had anything to do with it. Vic flatly replies 'yes', which Solana takes to mean 'no'. She traces her steps for around 15 minutes before giving up.
> - If the money is any other form of currency: She doesn't notice. She always has some cash or credit on hand, and she doesn't penny-pinch, so an extra $50 doesn't faze her.

Vic:

> - If the money is cash: Vic notices the discrepancy instantly. He asks Solana about it, but she doesn't have an answer. He briefly considers checking in with Alis, but figures he isn't the type of person to sneak him an extra $50. He determines that the change is not from someone else's portals, as they shouldn't be able to locate his wallet. He checks with me if it's my doing, and I'm forced to explain my actions.
> - If the money is cashless: (non-canonical) Traces down the discrepancy as listed on his financial balances. [Through a series of events, uncovers a hacker conspiracy ring by an enemy nation government.](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo's_Egg_(book)>)

Aside: It surprised me how much the clause "in their wallet" changes the response to the prompt. If the prompt used the clause "on the sidewalk" instead, the response would have changed dramatically.

> How do your characters tell a story? ([2022-11-12](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1041048098585202818), [source](https://additional-alignment-charts.tumblr.com/post/679359642009288704/))

Solana:

> Solana tries to keep the story on track. However, since she isn't the most eloquent, the story ends up drifting. She often interrupts the story and checks with the listener to make sure she's not just rambling, and she often concludes the story with a personal opinion or by philosophizing.

Vic:

> Vic cares more about results than what leads to that result, so he has a terse, to-the-point style. Because of this, he has a habit of making molehills out of mountains. If he is asked to explain these mountains, the answers he gives only raise more questions.

# Icebreaker 046

> What kind of building would your characters be? This could be a type of building, an architectural style, or a specific landmark. ([2022-11-17](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1042866547196182620))

# Icebreaker 047

> Snowball fight! How do your characters react if a friend pelts them with a snowball? ([2022-11-18](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1043229661502656573), [inspiration](https://twitter.com/tanijrou/status/1593413665075642370))

> Solana: Collects snow, packs it into a ball, walks up to assailant, and throws it close-range.

> Vic: Wants to play fair, so he avoids use of his supernatural abilities. Completely misses when throwing a snowball using his own hands, as he cannot use portals to error-correct.
