# Vignette 014 – Holiday Dinner Prelude

> Solana hears a strange humming coming from her kitchen one afternoon. Following this, she hears the sound of an opening fridge.
>
> Upon inspection, Solana finds Vic with a portal next to him. Suspended inside were a variety of groceries, including two jars of a red, fruity-looking sauce and a menagerie of spices. Vic was placing an apple inside the fridge.
>
> Inside the fridge already were a variety of foods she hadn't seen yesterday. The crisper was populated with a variety of produce both common and uncommon. The upper shelves held cured sausages and gamey-looking poultry. [The spiced cider Solana gave him a few days ago magically found its way in there, too.](2022-12-23_vignette-013_holiday-gifts.md)

> "What's with the groceries?" Solana asks.
>
> Vic glances over and gestures 'hi'. "It's for the holiday dinner!"
>
> Solana pinches her lips. "Isn't this a lot, though?" she asks. "It looks like we'd end up with a lot of leftovers."
>
> Vic nods and smiles. "If it were for only your companions and us, it would be."
>
> Solana notes how deliberate Vic's choice of words are. This was another of his puzzles.

> She wonders who or what he was alluding to—Vic might have been a gadfly, but social butterfly he wasn't.
>
> "Is someone else coming over?" she asks.
>
> Vic nods. He pauses briefly, then responds, "I got extra in case Alice decides to stop by."
>
> "You want me to ask who Alice is," she deduces. This was the first time Solana heard that name.
>
> "Quite right!" he replies. "You know about him already, but you haven't actually met him yet."
>
> After hearing his response, Solana's thought process comes to a screeching halt.
>
> "Alice is a guy?" she exclaims.
>
> Vic shrugs and tosses her a casual smile. "It would be weirder if he wasn't."
