# Rendition 025 – Fighting Game Palettes (2022-10-09)

<img src="assets/2022-10-12_image-040.png">

## Overview

Following [Icebreaker 014](2022-10-01_icebreaker-011-012-013-014.md) and [my subsequent fighting game mockup for Vicerre](2022-10-10_rendition-024_fighting-game-mockup.md), I created a series of color palettes using Vicerre as a base.

These palettes take inspiration from characters with similar tropes to Vicerre, which I will explain below.

## Explanation

## Scrapped ideas

- Albert Wesker (_Resident Evil_ series): This character is fun, but he is a Hollywood supervillain. In contrast, the other characters referenced are more granular and complex. Additionally, the palette used in his design had overlap with Vexen's palette.
- Spamton (_Deltarune_): Vicerre shares the same head shape and hair style as Spamton, but otherwise, the two characters are not thematically similar enough to warrant an allusion.
- Vlad Stein (_Blood Stain_): While Vicerre and Dr. Stein share tropes, Dr. Stein lacks the moral ambiguity other characters have, which led me to drop it from consideration.

## Design notes

- Font used: JetBrains Mono
- When designing palettes, I prioritized palettes based on color diversity. Therefore, the characters that had the most striking palettes were the first I designed palettes for.
- If a character had multiple iconic outfits, I used color diversity as a metric to determine which palette to use. For instance, the Twelfth Doctor is best known for his minimalistic black outfit. However, I referenced his red velvet outfit in creating a palette inspired by him, as that was unique. Likewise, instead of Takuto Maruki's regular outfit, I chose his Metaverse one, as it featured gold, which was also unique.
- By default, the palette inspired by Doctor Strange evoked Phoenix Wright instead. To ensure the right reference came across, I fine-tuned the palette such that the values used in it are more deliberate.
- [Darquezze306](https://www.tumblr.com/darquezze306) mentioned that fighting games often include red, green, and blue palette swaps for characters, in order to sort characters into teams. In my initial set of referenced characters, I had no characters that used green in their design, but I thought it was worth adding one. Eventually, using Darquezze's recommendation, I settled for Loid Forger from _Spy × Family_.
- [Darquezze306](https://www.tumblr.com/darquezze306) mentioned that the order of palettes matters in fighting games. Taking this into consideration, I organized my palettes according to a system. For the first eight palettes, I alternated between dark and light palettes, sorting each dark/light palette roughly in order of character similarity to Vicerre. I left the most colorful palettes as my last four palettes.
- I seem to have settled on palette names that provoke intrigue—these titles would make excellent titles for spy thriller novels.
