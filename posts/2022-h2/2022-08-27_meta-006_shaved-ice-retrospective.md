# Meta 006 – _Shaved Ice_ Retrospective

## Overview

As you may know, I have spent much of my spare time the past few months composing a narrative named _Shaved Ice_. Throughout this process, I have learned much about the process of long-form creative writing. For posterity, I have elected to keep a record of my findings and resources.

## Workflow

These are the following iterations I've identified in the process of writing _Shaved Ice_:

- Pantsing: Write the raw, pantsed story.
- Conceptualization: Identify major characters, primary tropes, key plot points, and thematic through-line.
- Outline 1: Write a high-level timeline (~1 page-long).
- Outline 2: Edit. Reorganize the high-level timeline for narrative flow. Identify what purpose each scene brings to the plot. Kill tangential sidequests and jot them down to be written later as bonus snippets.
- Script 1: Write low-level sequence of events. Infodump. Don't get flowery with language—just get to the end of the story!
  - Take notes on your characters as they develop. Review these notes consistently to ensure consistent characterization.
  - Define the mechanics of your 'verse. Document what rules you introduced, where you introduced them, and how they shape the plot.
- Script 2: Edit.
  - Identify points in the narrative where the story isn't advancing at the appropriate pace. Change the presented order of events or change scenes entirely to keep the pace appropriate.
  - Keep the story snappy. Use nonlinear storytelling to ensure each chapter sets off on an intriguing line. Use the past perfect tense afterwards to backfill the reader's knowledge of the plot.
  - Assuming you have defined the rules of your 'verse with sufficient rigor, identify when you are overexplaining (infodumping) within the story and remove those details. Let the reader piece together the rules.
  - Subsume infodumps into the narrative. E.g., instead of explicitly having the protagonist give his/her name/age/appearance, sprinkle these details in the context of a scene that doesn't cause the plot to grind to a halt.
  - Edit your characters. You might have a scene in your outline you are aiming to reach, but as you write, you notice that one of your character's motivations don't match up, and now he/she wants to do something different. If you're working with an end target in mind, you may need to change your character's motivations earlier in the story to fit your target.
- Script 3, 4, etc: Identify and incorporate tropes and other narrative devices that make your story a more intuitive read. Examples from _Shaved Ice_:
  - The name of the protagonist was initially "Solana", but it was changed to "Clementine", as this name had a narrative advantage. Unlike the name "Solana", the protagonist can identify whether those characters are trying to be friendly with her by whether they call her "Clem".
  - The alternate world the protagonist is sent to was tentatively called the Dream World. However, this name is ill-fitting. The idea of a Dream World inspires abstract, surreal imagery, whereas the alternate world the protagonist visits is more cohesive and designed with mental symbolism in mind. Thus, the name of this world was changed to the Mental Plane, which is more intuitive and indicative to readers.
  - One of the reveals in the story originally had an additional twist to it. As I read through the direction the story was going, however, I noticed that this additional twist made the reveal convoluted and confusing. For that reason, I changed the twist from the original story to one that was simpler to understand. Despite having changed one of the key plot points of _Shaved Ice_, I thought it would be more prudent to keep the characterization and themes of the story intact.
- Prose 1: Write enough prose such that it is pleasant to read. Get feedback on the plot + story structure. This process may be tricky for narratives where the first-time reading experience is important.
- Prose 2: Write flowery prose when relevant. Get feedback on prose.
