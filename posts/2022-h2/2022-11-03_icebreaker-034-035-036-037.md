# Icebreaker 035

> It's Halloween. What are your characters' reactions to receiving Halloween candy (regardless if they asked for it or not)? ([2022-10-28](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1035735647652171847), [Rigudon](https://twitter.com/Rigudawn))

> Solana: Isn't surprised by a random gift, but only realizes that this one isn't from Vic a few seconds later. Afterward, she thanks the stranger and asks them if they want any of her Halloween candy in exchange.
>
> Afterward, Solana tells Vic they got bonus candy, so he can take it easy on random surprise gifts. Initially, Vic objects, but he admits that would be the most suitable course of action.
>
> She snacks on them over time. The gummy-like ones are the first to go, followed by the chocolates, then pure sugary ones, then hard candies. She saves the nutty ones for when she feels like snacking on something substantial.

> Vic: Gives everything to Solana except for the peppermints and spicy ones. He then insists on taking the apple. Solana asks if she can guess what he's planning to make that apple into. Vic says "no" and portals away before she can object.

# Icebreaker 036

> How do your characters sleep? What do their bedrooms look like? When do they go to bed and wake up? Do they do anything special as a part of their bedtime ritual? ([2022-11-31](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1036751635092881499))

Solana:

> Her bedroom is fairly ordinary. It has a large mattress to accommodate Clementine and Nia, and it has a large window to let natural sunlight stream in.
>
> Solana uses Clementine as a pillow half of the time, and the frequency increases during winter months. She enjoys sleeping at a reasonable hour and waking up naturally. However, she often sleeps late, since late-night is when her creative juices are at their strongest. She love-hates the time between laying down in bed and sleeping, since that's always when she comes up with ideas.
>
> Since her bedroom doubles as one of her companions' play rooms, it becomes unkempt easily. She makes her bed every morning, but by the time she comes back later, there is usually a kitsune-shaped imprint on it.

---

Vic:

> His bedroom setup contains a high-end mattress and high-end pillows, blinds, and noise cancellation. Despite these features, his bedroom still receives a fair bit of noise from the ambient sounds of the city. He's built up a tolerance to that, however. Otherwise, the bedroom is fairly austere.
>
> He has been keeping a fairly consistent schedule recently due to having a motivation to wake up in the morning. He doesn't often use alarms due to his attuned circadian rhythm, but when he does, he makes sure to set it in accordance with his sleep cycle.

# Icebreaker 037

> How do your characters feel about bugs? ([2022-11-02](https://discord.com/channels/448538687983321098/1020875112045613217/1037537239502180352), Sunfished)

Vic:

> [It depends on the context:](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/depends-on-the-context)
>
> Meet them out in the wild? He finds them a bother compared to what he's _actually_ there for.
>
> Find a house centipede take up residence in his bedroom after waking up? Oh, aren't you the most interesting thing?
>
> Ask him to make you a centipede + eastern dragon hybrid? He'd love the chance to experiment with and design one of those.
>
> He also thinks [a certain spider-person](https://toyhou.se/Moppnttef/characters) is cool. 👍
