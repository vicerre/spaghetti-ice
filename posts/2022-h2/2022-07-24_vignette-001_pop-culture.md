> "'Sephiroth'? I haven't heard of such a term before."
>
> Solana grinned cheekily.
>
> "Well, let it out, what is it?" Vicerre asked. "It's one of those references from the real world, isn't it? One the Storyteller finds so amusing to keep me in the dark."
>
> "You're right about that," Solana replied.
>
> "Of course. Well, I suppose I'll go ahead and ask—does the term relate to seraphim or zephyrs? Ironically, even?"
>
> "Yes to 'seraphim', but not in the traditional sense."
>
> "Of course," he sighed. "And I fail to see why seraphim would be an appropriate comparison to the original point of discussion, in any case."
>
> Solana poked Vicerre's arm. "Well, the Storyteller _might_ have been referring to that one time when you..."
>
> Vicerre sniped an expression at her. "That time."
>
> Solana nodded. "Yep, that time."
>
> Vicerre thought for a moment. "Someone who has delusions of power and godhood?"
>
> Solana held her breath.
>
> Vicerre shrugged tightly. "I'll take it."
