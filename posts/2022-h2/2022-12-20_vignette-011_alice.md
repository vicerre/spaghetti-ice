# Vignette 011 – Alice

[non-canon]

> The two of them were on their way home when something strange happened: Vic locked up, and his irises changed color from blue to gold.
>
> Noticing this, Solana's eyes bulge.
>
> It was always a dangerous sign when Vic's irises turned gold:

> [He then had them when he was under the influence of the Exogeny. Among other things, that's what caused him to kill Zada.](../2021/2021-07-26_elucidation-004_character-personality.md)
>
> [But when Solana asked Vic if he could use his headlights for a Halloween photoshoot last year, he said he didn't have access to them anymore.](../2022-h1/2022-01-03_rendition-014_claws.md)

> What happened since then?

> Before Solana could question the situation any further, her attention gets diverted.
>
> Vic shook his head, pinched the bridge of his nose, then muttered, "Can this wait, Alice? I'm in the middle of something..."
>
> Solana blinks.
>
> She hadn't heard that name before. Judging by his tone, though, it seemed like Vic was familiar with her. Solana didn't take Vic as the womanizing type, though, so she wonders who Alice could be.
>
> She bumps her elbow against Vic.
>
> "...Alice?" she asks.

---

> Vic slowly swivels his head towards Solana, then scans her figure. His eyes remained that unnatural shade of gold.
>
> After a long, drawn-out breath, he replies, "...That is what Armin calls me. Until I formally make your acquaintance, however, you should think of me as Vicerre."
>
> Solana knows there's a lot to unpack in that response, but she doesn't get the time to ruminate.
>
> "Your name is Solana, correct?" he asks.
>
> Solana looks at him quietly and nods.
>
> He tilts his head slightly. "Consider this an early introduction, in that case."
>
> He slowly strolls around her. "Armin has told me much about you," he says. "The circumstances of your existence, [the epiphanies you inspire in him...](2022-11-05_vignette-004_enthralled.md)"
>
> He stops behind her. ["...How he adores it when you ruffle his hair," he flatly adds.](2022-11-11_icebreaker-041-042-043.md)
>
> He what.
>
> A spike of ice erupts from the ground beside him, the tip stopping just centimeters away from his temple.
>
> Solana shrieks.
>
> He turns and looks narrowly at the spike. His hand twitches, and the ice recedes.
>
> "...I see he doesn't appreciate me divulging that fact."

> Solana mulls for a moment, then looks up and says, "Hey, Vic?"
>
> He stares at her dispassionately. No response.
>
> Solana continues, "If you can hear me, can you grow some icicles at positions three, four, and nine?"
>
> She looks at the ground at Vic's feet, waiting to see if any ice emerges. Vic's hand twitches—a telltale sign—but nothing else happens. This time, Alice was prepared.
>
> This was enough of a response for Solana, though; Vic was listening, and Alice was actively suppressing him. Her eyebrows raise in reaction.
>
> "...I see you're testing me," he says.
>
> Solana nods. "As far as I see it, this is just like one of Vic's puzzles." With a warm smile, she adds, "I'm sure he'd want me to solve it."
>
> As if Vic were answering her, small deposits of ice form at his feet at positions three, four, and nine.

> "...Miss Solana," he says, "I came here to deliver a message, not to play games. This is a matter of your own existence."
>
> Solana's smile quickly turns into an expression of concern. "My... existence?" she replies, tone hushed. After a delay, she asks, "What do you mean by that?"
>
> With a flick of the wrist, he opens a portal. On the other side was the inside of a familiar building—one with pale fluorescent lights and a menagerie of technical equipment.
>
> Solana furrows her brow at Alice. How on Earth did he discover Vic's lab? The only way in and out of there is through Vic's portals; no one knew where it _actually_ was besides Vic himself.
>
> ...Actually, no. There was another possibility.

> Vic's lab contained the interdimensional portal. Alice could have arrived through it, then found a way out. [That's how Solana found out from Vic he met an alternate version of himself,](2022-07-29_vignette-002_interdimensional.md) and that's how she got—
>
> Wait.
>
> '_You should think of me as Vicerre,_' he said.
>
> It all clicked. That's why Alice referred to Vic as 'Armin'. That's why the symptoms of Vic's behavior resembled those of Arclight. And that's why Vic was calm during the initial takeover.
>
> ...So wait. That means Alice is a guy. Huh.
>
> She looks up, barges past Vic, and enters the portal.
>
> From the other side, a familiar voice meets her.
>
> "Hello again, Miss Solana."
