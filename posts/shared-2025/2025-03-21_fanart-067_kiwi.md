> 2. Vic: Responds, a little confused – he was expecting the Storyteller of this 'verse
> 3. Ice guy: _He's in my cloak. I'm [name] by the way. Ice and fire guy, like you and your girlfriend_

> 2. _But you've inspired me to move her into a different role_
> 3. _Ruh is no longer delegated to non-canon storytelling. She can only oversee the canon_
> 4. _Your presence – the non-canon – is now under my protection and oversight_
> 5. _She's not going to apologise, that is the truth in all honesty, and like Ishi, I like being honest._

> 8. _Mari, well, harassing Alis, but I think it's cute_

> 1. _And lastly, Ishi. Remember that time you took his DNA sample?_
> 2. _You're the reason he..._
