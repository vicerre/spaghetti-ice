> **Solana:** First thing that comes to mind is a Circle of Wildfire Druid. Wildshape? Check. Fire spells? Check (with the curious omission of _fireball_). It also grants you a flame spirit familiar (which funnily enough, is depicted as a fox in the sourcebook this subclass comes from). If the nature theming's not for you, however, a good ol'-fashioned Evocation Wizard with a bent towards fire spells and _polymorph_ will do the trick.

> **Alis:** The spitting image of an Enchantment Wizard. Enchantment is all about influencing and dominating other creatures. There's also a good pool of ice spells to pick from to supplement his arsenal, like _ice knife_ and _Rime's binding ice_. If you wish to go the extra mile, he can also multiclass into an Artificer for the machine tinkering flavor. One of the tricks (or "infusions") they can learn is building a magical construct called a homunculus, which can suit Trace

> **Vic:** All of 5e's teleporting spells are in the conjuration school of magic, so a Conjuration Wizard works for Vic. Conjuration also concerns summoning spells; perhaps these can be flavored as Vic pulling them out of a portal? Being a Wizard, you also have the same pool of ice spells to choose from. Like Alis, he can also multiclass into Artificer for the scientist flavor. Closest we got there is Alchemist, though, since unfortunately 5e doesn't really have an analogue for bioengineering.
