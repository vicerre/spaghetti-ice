# Meta 037 â€“ Stable Diffusion for Art Commission Descriptions

I've written multiple posts before on this blog about Stable Diffusion. It's an open-source and community-supported image generation model.

In the past, I've written how I've used it for developing ideas as an artist. If you have an idea but don't know how to draw it, Stable Diffusion can act as an excellent tool for identifying ideas that work.

Since then, I've found value in it as an art commissioner.

Recently, I commissioned @Yokaiju for character art. Yokaiju is an artist who excels when provided with ample instruction. To commission him in a way that satisfies both parties, I need to describe my request to him.

When commissioning a piece, I have a loose idea of what composition I want. This gets written and shared as a description. When shared, another artist can produce a completely different image than expected. This can lead to the uncomfortable situation in which the image isn't what you were thinking but the artist put in too much work to take back.

Stable Diffusion remedies this uncomfortable situation. Instead of expending effort communicating your request on a human, you can test your request against a machine. Often times, the machine will produce a valid, if unexpected result. By identifying what you omitted originally, you can refine your description to be more accurate.

## Miscellaneous notes

- ChatGPT is another resource I found helpful in refining a commission description. By providing the description to the service, I can ask where it thinks I am being unclear.
- Prompt engineering can be a double-edged sword. While helpful for producing a piece to specifications, it strips the artist of their creative freedom. What I love most about commissioning artists is the human behind the artwork, so optimally, I want commissions to expose the artist's personal touch. However, some artists work better with a more guided approach.
