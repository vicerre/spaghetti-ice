# Vignette 085 – A Special Task

> Neko was sitting on the kitchen sill, bright-eyed. He had freshly returned from one of his excursions, and Clementine noticed he carried something back with him.
>
> Wrapped around one of his ears was a strange device. It looked like a sprig of laurel or garland—only, instead of wood and leaves, it was made of a white, synthetic material. Embedded in its body was an unmistakably distinct design, a crystalline orange core.
>
> Coming up to him, Clementine asks, "What were you up to today?"

---

> "Wellll," Neko says, "I went to say 'hi' to Mister Vicerre. He has a lotta stuff in his lab now, like a pool that goes sideways and a coat that's also a bed! I spent a lotta time checking his place out."
>
> Clementine gently extends one hand and rubs Neko's cheek. "Is that right?" she replies.
>
> "Mister Vicerre"—or Alis, as his friends had taken to calling him—had been busy setting up Horn and Ivory recently. Clementine had been contacted to help set up the lab, and Neko, it seemed, took an unscheduled trip to see it, too.
>
> "Ya-huh," he replies, lifting his tail. "Oh, oh, oh! And then, he said he had a special task for me."
>
> "Oh? What 'special task' would that be?"

> Neko circles around and shows off the strange device on his head. "He gave me this!" he cries. "It's supposed to look inside my head. He told me I should keep it on and go outside for a week. He said it's very important I stay outside the lab for this."
>
> Hearing this, Clementine can't help but grin. "Did he now?" she asks. "You know, it's a big responsibility to watch something for a week." Then, she takes one hand and pets his ears. "You think you can handle that?"
>
> Neko purrs. "Of course I can!" he cries.
>
> His tail then falters. "Well, maybe not a _whole_ week. This thing is starting to get itchy."
