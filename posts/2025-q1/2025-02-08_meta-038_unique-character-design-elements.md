# Meta 038 – Unique Character Design Elements

Throughout my explorations with Stable Diffusion, I've come across discussions and analyses on generated image accuracy. We all know how small image generation models can't draw hands with the right number of fingers or how it has trouble with spatial awareness. From an artist's perspective, however, there's something else interesting to address—the model's ability to draw unique design elements.

Stable Diffusion learns by predicting the most likely outcome from a base (sometimes meaningless) image. This means that it has an easier time predicting common concepts and a harder time predicting obscure concepts. When applied to character design, this means that unique character design elements are harder for the model to draw.

In my universe, I give my characters fairly unique designs. Most of my characters use common design elements, but within each character, I incorporate at least one design element that is highly distinctive. Even when Stable Diffusion is trained to draw these characters, it has a hard time drawing the element that is highly distinctive. In essence, you can determine how unique a design element is by testing how easy it is for a generative image model to draw it.

The unique design element on each of my characters are:

- Alis: the belts on his coat
- Solana: her portal armbands
- Vic: the shape of his scarf

Another way to determine which elements make a character design distinct is to ask the model to draw them as something else (e.g. an animal). By asking the model to draw characters this way, the most iconic character design traits will be preserved.

The distinct design elements on each of my characters are:

- Alis: bangs, gems, narrowness, ruff, white
- Solana: eyelashes, fiery mane, orange-red
- Vic: brown, multicolored hair, nose, scarf

## Miscellaneous notes

- While unique, I don't give my characters an _iconic_ design element. Iconic design characters are great for character recognition across all of fiction. However, they aren't great if these characters are meant to share the spotlight.
