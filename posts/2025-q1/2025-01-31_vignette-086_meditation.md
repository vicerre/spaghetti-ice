# Vignette 086 â€“ Meditation...?

> _"Slow down."_
>
> Vic was in an unusual spot this evening. He had been in Solana's house plenty of times, yes, and even Solana's bedroom thanks to his portals, but... well, there he was, sitting off the edge of her bed, a human-kitsune hybrid behind him, her head resting against his shoulder, her arms wrapped around his body, and a sweep of tails brushing against him so _gently_.
>
> _"Take a deep breath."_
>
> There was a stress Vic sought to soothe this evening he couldn't do alone, so he requested Solana's presence for help. Upon hearing his needs, Solana offered him a specific suggestion.
>
> _"Clear your thoughts."_
>
> Officially, they had initiated a meditation, an escape from the qualms that had stained this closing day. It was a respite they could count on, regardless of what else might transpire. Between Solana and Vic, though, it also served as something more personal.

> For Vic, there was no better respite than to give in to the person of your dreams. _"Focus on me,"_ Solana would say, and Vic knew it was a fool's errand to resist. Fifteen minutes into their session, his muscles were mush, and his thoughts were a fuzzy cloud of red.
>
> It's then Solana murmurs something into his ear. It was a sweet message, and one so gentle. And yet, in the absence of all else, it was resounding, as though she had struck a bell and the clang resonated against his soul.
>
> For a moment, his eyes dilate, a flash of lucidity threatening to snatch him. And yet, he remained in her presence, captivated, spellbound, his state of being a product of her wiles. The light in his eyes fades, his will submerged into the one he so loves.
>
> In that moment, nothing else mattered.
