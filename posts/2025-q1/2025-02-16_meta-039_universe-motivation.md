# Meta 039 â€“ Universe Motivation

When I develop my universe, I interact with people who also work on material for their own universes. In doing so, I find the motivations people have for developing these fictional universes.

Examples of motivations people have for developing universes include the following:

- People want to create a portfolio project and populate it with their creativity.
- People want to record their experiences of a tabletop game or video game character they played.
- People want to explore experiences of real life in a safe environment.

In each category except for the final one, people immerse their characters into a particular project. In the final category, people immerse their projects through their characters.

My universe falls under the final category. I take my experiences, creative or otherwise, and use my characters as a medium for exploring them. The result is that I end up "going wide" with my creative content instead of "going deep".

Mediums I have explored as of writing include:

- anime/manga
- digital art
- generative AI
- merchandise
- newspaper comics
- puzzles
- roleplays
- screenplays (once)
- TCGs
- webapps
- webcomics
- YA fiction

The following are examples of media I will not invest in (these require me to draw characters more consistently than is fun):

- 2D animation
- 3D modeling
- video game
