# Illustration 086 – Selfie 4 (2025-01-19)

<img src="assets/2025-01-19_image-262.png">

## Overview

Team Arklight goes to watch a solar eclipse.

This image is the fourth in my series of character selfies.

## Design notes

- Originally, I wanted to draw a selfie showing the development of Solana's and Vic's relationship. However, I did not want to include Alis as a [third wheel](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/third_wheel), so I opted for an alternate composition.
- In contrast to my previous selfie illustrations, I opted for a vertical composition over a horizontal composition.
- In contrast to my previous selfie illustrations, Alis is depicted smiling.
