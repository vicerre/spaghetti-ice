# Meta 035 â€“ Player Number Four

As of writing, my core cast consists of three members: Vic, Solana, and Alis. Through dozens of blog posts, I explored these characters through writing, art, and other creative media.

I've come to notice limitations with my characters, however:

- There are times I want to write a scenario, but my characters lack the personalities necessary to work in the idea.
- There are times I want to draw something novel.

A fourth member of the core cast could solve these problems. This character could provide new creative inspiration, acting as a breath of fresh air.

In theory, this character would be easy to create: all I would need is to identify and design a character from the missing gaps. In practice, though, this is insufficient; my characters need a purpose to remain core cast members. Simply "filling in the gaps" is not enough.

Until I find said purpose, I will not create a new character. However, I will still catalog the gaps that exist between my characters, which may serve as future character inspiration.

Narrative gaps:

- I want to give Solana a female character to talk to (who isn't a deity).
- I want to encapsulate elements of my personality that don't exist in a character or exist in minor characters.

Note: Chemistry between any new characters and existing characters is paramount.

Visual gaps:

- My characters are defined by the colors red/orange (Solana), yellow/green (Alis), blue/purple (Vic), and black/white (Storyteller). Options for colors that could be fun to explore include pink, bright yellow, or (less importantly) purple.
- For the sake of art style, I want to design a male character with fewer angular features than Vic and Alis.
- It may be interesting to design a character with a nonstandard body type. However, I would not be able to write them authentically.
