# Rendition 077 â€“ Alis Icon (2024-11-09)

<img src="assets/2024-11-09_image-228.png">

## Overview

This image is an icon of Alis. In the image, Alis is depicted with a moody, pensive expression.

## Design notes

- On 2024-11-06, my mental health declined. I wanted to replace my Discord profile icon with something more serious. Therefore, I decided to draw Alis with a moodier expression. In the process of doing so, however, I made the drawing too moody, and thus, incompatible for use as a profile icon.
- The piece is set on Vic's floating island under the cherry tree.
- This piece takes place during autumn.

## Story notes

The inspiration for this piece comes from [Vignette 077](../2024-q3/2024-07-24_vignette-077_out-of-doors.md).

Ever since Vic introduced Alis to the island, Alis has revisited the cherry tree on occasion. Given the secluded nature of the island, the cherry tree is a prime location for Alis to collect his thoughts and meditate in peace.
