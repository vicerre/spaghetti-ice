# Illustration 073 – Another Time, Another Place (2024-11-14 – 2024-11-17)

<img src="assets/2024-11-14_image-229.png">

## Overview

A manga-style illustration depicting Alis sharing his past with his universe's Armin to Solana.

## Design notes

- This image may be motivated by current life events.
- In composing this page, I applied the following artistic effects:
  - In the main panel, the curvature of the cables in the background matches the curvature of Solana's speech balloons.
  - The dark shadow Solana casts over Armin's picture mirrors Armin's absence.
