# Meta 034 – Horn and Ivory Naming

For a long time, I wanted to figure out the name of Alis's business. However, like any name in my universe, the name had to be meaningful in a multitude of ways.

<!-- Early on, "Thoughtiron" was a name that came to mind. While evocative, it lacked the subtlety I valued. -->

On 2024-11-12, I was reminded of the term ["ivory tower"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_tower).

I thought the term was inspiring:

- It suggests a sense of intellectual isolation.
- Alis visually fits the depiction of an ivory tower.
- However, the phrase "ivory tower" is typically used disparagingly.

I would not use the term itself. Instead, however, it would lead me to the right place.

I found the term ["gates of horn and ivory"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_horn_and_ivory) from "ivory tower".

I thought the term was inspiring:

- This phrase refers to the contrast between dreams and reality. Replacing or supplanting reality with dreams, as well as its reverse, is a theme in Alis's character arc.
- Alis's visual design matches the literal meaning of "horns and ivory". Alis's hair is styled not unlike horns, and he dresses in white akin to ivory.
- The term is used by a neural network library named Keras by project ONEIROS. This is a delightful match against Alis's own neuroscience and Oneiros.

Given the depth of these connections, I knew I had to use it as a name for my universe.
