# Vignette 082 — Absolution

> Dear part of me,
>
> It's been a while since we last chatted, hasn't it? We started our journey eleven years ago, when I was naïve and ambitious and so, so very cynical. Our sense of self has broken down and mended itself eight times to date, if I count correctly. If we were a cat, we would need to be cautious about our next life.
>
> I'm not here to reminisce about past events, though. Instead, I'm here to apologize.

> [Not too long ago, Solana had an epiphany.](../2024-q1/2024-01-19_vignette-067_role.md) She couldn't find fulfillment solely through others, and instead, she had to find it in herself first.
>
> After thinking about it, I realized I'm the same:
>
> For the longest of times, I was cruel and cowardly. When confronted with my actions, I painted you as the cause. _It wasn't me,_ I would say, _it was this blasted \_part of me_ I had to expunge.\_ This part of me, of course, being the party responsible for holding the innocent part hostage.
>
> Well, we both agree you aren't innocent. However, I can't call myself innocent, either.
>
> I've tried to deliver others penance. Between Ishi, Solana, Zada, and Alis, you would think I absolved myself. Yet, no matter what I did, my actions never cleansed the stain on my conscience—and for good reason:
>
> Ultimately, my actions never changed the fact you knew the truth: I was broken as a person, and I blamed it on you.
>
> For that reason, I'm sorry.

---

> It's selfish of me, isn't it?
>
> I'm apologizing at a time when I've built up an enjoyable life—one where I can afford to endure a little pain. Yet, it's only when I have the time and quietude to think can I notice something important is amiss. I've realized can't accept this life knowing I forsook you to claim it. Instead, I think you deserve the chance to enjoy it, too.
>
> I don't expect you to accept my apology. I don't expect you to do _anything_ for me, much less right someone who has wronged you in the past. All I can do is offer you these words and space.
