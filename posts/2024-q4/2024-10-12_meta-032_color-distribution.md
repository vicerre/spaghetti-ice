# Meta 032 – Character Design Color Distribution

<img src="assets/2024-10-12_image-225.png">

## Overview

Color distribution breakdowns of my characters, visualized as pie charts.

## Design notes

- I used a Fibonacci-based weight system to determine the size of each slice.
- The colors in each pie chart are roughly ordered by hue + vibrance.

## Resources used

- [Color theme from image | Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image)
