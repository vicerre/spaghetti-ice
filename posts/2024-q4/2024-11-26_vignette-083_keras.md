# Vignette 083 – Keras

> Solana and Armin had assigned themselves to Alis's lab today.
>
> Over the past several weeks, the lab had been in a state of transition. Solana and Armin—along with the occasional third party—insisted on helping themselves over to install the new instruments and machinery that would occupy the space.
>
> For the most part, Alis accepted Solana and Armin as warranted, and while he valued their attendance, he didn't dwell on them.
>
> Today, however, he couldn"t help but find himself aware of them.

> Project Keras was the key.
>
> As an extension of Project Oneiros, this was the project Alis concentrated on after establishing the lab. Like Project Oneiros, the mechanism relied on the same principles, tracing correlated memories and coalescing them into a singular neural pattern. Unlike Project Keras, however, it harnessed an artificial, external network instead of one"s own—producing a final resultant "Trace".
>
> Despite similarities in their designs, Alis notices a marked discrepancy between the two projects. With Oneiros, Alis was more lenient with its applications. In particular, one of his original uses was to develop a replica of him. With Keras, in contrast, he refused to perform the analogous procedure. Instead, the idea of tracing "his" Armin came across as anathema.
>
> It"s when he deliberates over this discrepancy that he comes to a realization.

> Every moment Alis spent with "his" Armin, he forged new experiences and memories. When he wanted him back, his subconscious desire was to develop new such memories. The revulsion that came with the idea of tracing "his" Armin came from the recognition that doing so would pervert the existing ones.
>
> It was never "his" Armin he wanted back. Instead, he realizes he was looking for something else.

> Alis"s mind flashes to his experiences with Solana and Armin—[the holiday dinner they had one winter](../2022-h2/2022-12-28_vignette-015_first-impressions.md), [the breaking point](../2023-q3/2023-08-27_vignette-044_breaking-point.md), [the conundrums they encountered in Armin"s Headscape](../2024-q2/2024-06-13_rendition-062_combination-lock.md), [the quiet moments on the island sanctuary](2024-11-10_rendition-077_icon.md), and more. In each incident, he couldn"t say either were exactly functional. Yet, thinking back, he values their sincerity all the same. As much as he might disregard their antics, they begat new and lasting memories all the same.
>
> With this observation in tow, he decides to check on Solana and Armin.
