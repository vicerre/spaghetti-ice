Bad:
- alto (doesn't seem to work?)
- charming (too spontaneous)
- confident (too low)
- curious (seems more inquisitive than naive?)
- innocent (sounds kiddish and naive)
- naive (sounds slightly juvenile)
- professorial (stuffy and stern-sounding)
- rounded (a little low)
- tenor (not high enough)
- transatlantic (doesn't seem to affect results)
