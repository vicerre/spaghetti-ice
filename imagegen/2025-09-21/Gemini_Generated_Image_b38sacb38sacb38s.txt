Generate a highly detailed anime-style background of the inside of an astronomical observatory using the reference images attached to this message as indirect inspiration. The dome walls have the color of light-colored wood and have architectural ribs along the inside. On the ground are a variety of astronomical instruments, including a very large telescope, railings to walk along the perimeter, a visible construction beams, industrial-looking lights, and other machinery. The dome is slid open to expose the night sky above. The observatory has a somewhat old-fashioned aesthetic to it; you could imagine it existing in Victorian times with an astrolabe and dusty shelves of books among the various devices in the chamber.
