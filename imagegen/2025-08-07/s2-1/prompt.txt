Medium shot of the interior of a Victorian era train like the Orient Express with a female redhead as the focus. The scene in the quality and style of an award-winning 2D hand-drawn Miyazaki anime film.

The redhead sitting in a booth in the train, leaning sideways against the glass of the train window. She has a gentle, demure expression, and her eyes are closed, fast asleep. Outside the window is a vibrant, green, idyllic landscape with a sunny blue sky, some warm yellow light casting a light over her face. The landscape outside shifts as the train moves. The camera is static.

The character slowly stirs--squinting a little due to the light cast from outside. She slowly stretches, yawns, rubs her eyes, then sits upright, then turns to face the window, her expression changing from tiredness to a bright optimistic expression as she does.
