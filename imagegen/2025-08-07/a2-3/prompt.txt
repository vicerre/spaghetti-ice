Medium shot of a man tinkering at a wooden desk inside a quaint, almost rustic-looking Florentine-style laboratory. The man is narrow, has brownish-oliveish hair (trust me on this), and is wearing a long, white coat with fur trim, a tiny orange lozenge brooch, six tiny orange lozenge buttons along each side + dark green-blue waistcoat. The man looks and focuses on the parts, which are small, electronic, and sci-fi looking. Then, he puts them together, causing a tiny, orange-white lozenge-shaped hologram to appear while he's looking at it. There is a large, arched glass window shining golden hours rays of light behind him.

The scene has the quality and style of an award-winning 2D hand-drawn Miyazaki anime film. The scene has dramatic lighting and shading. The animation has a slow, cinematic quality to it.

Negative prompt: blond hair, fair hair, brown hair, platinum hair, speaking, talking, white fur
