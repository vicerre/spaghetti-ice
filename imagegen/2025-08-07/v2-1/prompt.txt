Ultra wide shot of a man with two-tone hair walking around with a large, modern, mildly sci-fi white-colored laboratory. The camera performs a 360 degree pan as it tracks the man at eye level as he walks.

The scene has the quality and style of an award-winning 2D hand-drawn Miyazaki anime film. The animation has a slow, cinematic quality to it.

Negative prompt: Bird's eye view.
