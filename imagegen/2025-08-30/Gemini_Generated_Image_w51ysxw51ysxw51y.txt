Redraw the character in the first image in the style of a 2020s seinen anime screencap, full HD, using the second image as the background. The character should look "cool" insetead of "cute". The scene should be backlit with harsh, gold lighting, while the front of the figure should be half in light, half in shadow. Make sure you repose + restyle the character + background so the art styles mesh with each other, simplifying and extrapolating the background if needed.
