Can you redraw the character in the image attached in the style of an animesque cover? The cover is illustrated in a watercolor style. The image is drawn using a portrait aspect ratio using the second image as reference. The image depicts this character taking a spoonful of strawberry ice cream out of a clear crystal cup. The character is standing in a snow-covered park with skyscrapers in the background, and there is a small flurry of snowflakes blowing his scarf a little. The character's eyes are looking in the direction of the camera in subtle surprise. The character is curved on the right side of the image facing left. The scene + background is drawn in an strong curved perspective, with the head being the part closest to the camera and the shoes being the farthest. The lighting is neutral like a partly-sunny day. If possible, make the title of the cover "Spaghetti Ice" in English with Japanese below it.
