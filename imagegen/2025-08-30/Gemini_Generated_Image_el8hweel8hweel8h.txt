Redraw the character in the first image (the character with red-orange hair) as a 1/6 figurine using the pose of the character in the second image. Place the figurine on a light-colored desk with what appears to be blurry, anime- and video game-looking merch on shelves behind her. On the desk is a computer showing what appears to be a screen from a 9th-generation fighting game showing the character fully-rendered in-game as a 3D model.
